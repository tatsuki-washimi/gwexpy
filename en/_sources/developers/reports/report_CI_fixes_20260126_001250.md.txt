# Work Report: CI Ruff/Test Fixes (20260126_001250)

## Metadata
- Date: 2026-01-26 00:12:50 (local)
- Model: GPT-5 (Codex CLI)
- Time taken: not tracked

## Summary
- Repaired notebook JSON corruption in `docs/ja/guide/tutorials/intro_timeseries.ipynb` by converting malformed `try`/import lines into proper notebook string entries.
- Cleaned notebook import blocks and warning filters to satisfy Ruff/I001 in interop and ARIMA tutorial notebooks.
- Removed unused `lal` import in `gwexpy/__init__.py` and ensured pytest uses local source via `pythonpath = ["."]`.
- Investigated pytest failure caused by importing installed `gwexpy` instead of workspace code; fixed by configuring pytest import path.

## Files Modified
- `docs/ja/guide/tutorials/intro_timeseries.ipynb` (fixed invalid JSON; repaired multiple malformed `try` blocks)
- `docs/ja/guide/tutorials/intro_interop.ipynb` (import order and warning filter cleanup; removed unused `lal` import in notebook)
- `examples/advanced-methods/tutorial_ARIMA_Forecast.ipynb` (import block formatting)
- `examples/basic-new-methods/intro_Interop.ipynb` (import ordering and warning filter block cleanup)
- `gwexpy/__init__.py` (removed unused `lal` import)
- `pyproject.toml` (added `pythonpath = ["."]` under pytest options)

## Tests Executed
- `ruff check .` (pass after notebook JSON repair)
- `mypy .` (pass)
- `pytest -vv -x` (failed at `tests/fields/test_physics_check.py::test_physics_units` due to installed package usage; resolved by `pythonpath` fix)
- `pytest -q tests/fields/test_physics_check.py::test_physics_units -vv -x` (pass after `pythonpath` fix)

## Issues / Notes
- `gwexpy/fitting/core.py` has unrelated changes from another task and was intentionally left untouched.
- Full test suite was not re-run after the `pythonpath` fix; consider running `pytest -vv -x` to confirm.

## Skill Updates
- No new skills added or existing skills updated.
