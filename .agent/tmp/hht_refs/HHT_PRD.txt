The Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) consists of empirical mode decomposition (EMD), which
is a template-free method that represents the combination of different intrinsic modes on a timefrequency map (i.e., the Hilbert spectrum). The application of HHT involves introducing trials by
imposing white noise on the signal and then calculating the ensemble mean process of the corresponding EMD to demonstrate its significance on the Hilbert spectrum. In this study, we develop
a stacked Hilbert-Huang Transform (sHHT) method that generates the Hilbert spectrum for each
trial and compiles all results to enhance the strength of the real instantaneous frequency of the main
signal on the time-frequency map. This new approach is more sensitive to detecting/tracing the
nonlinear and transient features of a signal embedded in astronomical databases than the conventional HHT, particularly when the signal experiences dramatic frequency changes in a short time.
We analytically investigate the consistency of HHT and sHHT and perform numerical simulations
to examine the dispersion of the instantaneous frequency obtained through sHHT and compare
its advantages and effectiveness with those of conventional HHT. To confirm the feasibility of the
sHHT, we demonstrate its application in verifying the signal of superorbital modulation in X-ray
and binary black hole mergers in gravitational waves.

INTRODUCTION

The development of multi-messenger astronomy in the
recent decade amplifies the scope of the application in
dynamical timing analysis; for example, the strain data
related to the gravitational wave (GW) or the light curve
of observation only contain information on time variation, and only the dynamical timing analysis is expected
to discover intriguing events or the background signal [1–
4]. Furthermore, in order to efficiently study the chirp
pattern of a candidate GW event originated from the
compact binary coalescence (CBC) on the time-frequency
map, Q-transform [5] was treated as the most common
algorithm applied for a fast scan to trace the behavior of
the signal while the Omicron software [6] derived from
the Omega scans pipeline [1] based on the Q-transform
were then developed to perform such a multi-resolution
time-frequency analysis of data obtained from the L-VK (i.e., aLIGO-aVirgo-KAGRA) observational network
[7]. Compared with the aforementioned method, we also
note that the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) is another
novel dynamical analytical approach of time series widely
applied to study the variation of a signal in many subjects, including medical applications [8, 9], finance [10],
earthquakes [11, 12], ocean/water waves [13, 14], and astronomy [15, 16]. Although HHT computation is more
time-consuming, investigation of GW via HHT still has
many benefits, and it also has great potential to inves-

tigate the CBC events [17–20] or burst-type GW signal (e.g., core collapsed supernovae; [21, 22]). Based on
HHT, Son et al. [23] also developed an event trigger generator (i.e., EtaGen) with a performance comparable to
the Omicron claimed by the developer.
Compared with the standard fast Fourier transform
and the wavelet method, HHT is an adaptive algorithm
that does not impose a prior basis set on the data. HHT
decomposes an original time series data set into different intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and then identifies
the instantaneous frequency (IF) along with the associated instantaneous amplitude (IA) to further obtain the
Hilbert spectrum [24]. The IF of HHT varies with time,
distinguishing it from the constant value determined by
frequency in the Fourier analysis. Therefore, HHT is suitable for analyzing non-linear and non-stationary signals.
In addition, the IF of HHT can indicate a modulation
of a base frequency over a small portion of the wave cycle, characterizing it as a differentiation algorithm for
extracting a signal’s local waveform. Compared to the
Fourier transform, HHT was claimed to provide a relatively high-resolution spectrogram on the time-frequency
map to dynamically trace a signal behavior (i.e., Fig. 5
in Camp et al. [17]). This viewpoint is firmly established
by the findings from simulated CBC [17] and core collapsed supernova explosion [21] signals, and a thorough
comparison of the resolution between HHT and wavelet
for a CBC event clearly shows the superior advantages
of using HHT (Fig. 4 of Hu et al. [22]). Through crosscorrelation of the high-resolution IF resolved from the
data, HHT is also expected to check the physical time
delays of events between the GW detectors [20] and the
merger or post-merger phases of binary neutron star (NS)

2
coalescences [18]. Due to its unique characteristics, HHT
is anticipated to be a powerful tool for studying nonlinear
and transient GWs.
The original decomposition method proposed for HHT
is empirical mode decomposition (EMD; [25]), which extracts IMFs by removing the local mean values obtained
from the average of the upper and lower envelopes of a
time series. A signal with a large/broad modulation time
scale can be decomposed into multiple IMFs by such an
iterative process to lead to the “mode-mixing” or “modesplitting” problems. These problems can be alleviated
by introducing white noise with finite amplitude into the
data and then taking the ensemble mean of the corresponding IMFs from all simulated datasets, and this improved approach is known as the ensemble EMD (EEMD;
[24]) method. Nevertheless, the merger phase of the GW
signal, which occurs during the coalescence of two compact objects, spans a wide frequency range. This complicates the decomposition into a single IMF, even with
EEMD, and spreads the information across multiple intrinsic modes. We have developed an algorithm to stack
the time-frequency maps by employing the HHT multiple times to determine the final Hilbert spectrum [22].
The pattern of the GW signal can be traced by inspecting the evolutionary track of the Hilbert energy, forming
a remarkable feature in a two-dimensional series of time
and IMF indices. In this paper, we aim to systematically
prove the feasibility of this stacking algorithm and conduct more detailed tests using artificial and real signals.

METHOD

The HHT is an empirical tool for time-frequency analysis and employs a nonlinear approach. It is well known
that HHT is more effective for non-stationary signals
than the traditional method, which assumes constant frequency and amplitude.
The Hilbert transform of a function x(t) is
Z ∞
1
x(t)
y(t) = p.v.
dτ
(1)
π
t
−∞ − τ
where p.v. is the Cauchy principal value of the singular
integral. While y(t) is the transform from the function
x(t), the analytic function can be defined
z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) = a(t)eiθ(t)

(2)

y
θ = arctan .

is necessary for the IF calculation method to function
appropriately.
An arbitrary time series x(t) consists of internal noise
and a few numbers of purely oscillatory functions. Therefore, a method of EMD is proposed by Huang et al. [25]
to probe the IFs through the Hilbert transform. Each
component defined as an IMF should satisfy the following conditions: (1) In the entire data set, the number of
extrema and zero crossings must either be equal or differ
by at most one. (2) At any given data point, the mean
value of the envelopes created from only the local maxima and the local minima is zero. Moreover, an EMD
decomposes a time series x(t) into a sum of IMFs (ck )
and the residual rNm as
x(t) =

p
x2 + y 2 ,

Here, a(t) is the IA, and θ is the instantaneous phase. So
the IF is
f=

ω
1 dθ
=
2π
2π dt

(4)

Huang et al. [25] noted that a purely oscillatory function (or a mono-component) with a zero reference level

ck (t) + rNm (t),

(5)

k=1

where Nm is a positive integer that represents the number of IMFs. The EMD can separate data into different
components by their scales. Given that some data often contains noise of significant amplitude, a pertinent
question arises: does a component (an IMF for EMD)
reveal a true signal, or is it merely a result of noise?
We notice that a single IMF can either consist of signals at different scales or contain signals of similar scales
within various IMF components. It is so-called modemixing and is also one of the major drawbacks of EMD.
To address the scale mixing problem, Huang and Wu [26]
and Huang and Shen [27] proposed the EEMD algorithm,
which defines the true IMF components as the average of
an ensemble of trials, each consisting of the signal plus
a finite amplitude white noise. EEMD contains the following steps: (1) add a white noise series to the targeted
data; (2) decompose the data with the added white noise
into IMFs; (3) repeat steps 1 and 2 again and again, but
with different white noise levels each time; and (4) obtain the (ensemble) means of corresponding IMFs from
the decomposition as the final result. In more detail, an
arbitrary x(t) function under the jth “artificial” observation will be
xj (t) = x(t) + nj (t),

(6)

where nj (t) is the jth realization of the white noise series
[24]. Furthermore, the intrinsic mode ck (t) is defined by
N

t

ck,j (t)
Nt →∞ Nt
j=1

ck (t) = lim

and
a(t) =

Nm
X

(7)

with
ck,j (t) = ck (t) + rk,j (t).

(8)

Nt in eq. (7) refers to the total number of trials for adding
the white noise series, and rk,j (t) in eq. (8) denotes the
contribution to the kth IMF from the white noise added
during the jth trial in the noise-added signal. To detect a signal that experiences an abrupt frequency change
within a short time (e.g., CBCs), the IMFs ck (t) and the

3
effects of rk,j (t) must be revised. By applying the Hilbert
transform to IMFs ck (t) along with the realization of frequency as described in equation (4), we can visualize a
time-frequency plot, and this process is referred to as
time-frequency realization. Meanwhile, the process defined in (7) is called the ensemble mean process.
Here, we concentrate on modifying the conventional
HHT with the application of only EMD. Let’s begin by
introducing the stacked spectrum of the HHT for each
trial xj (t). j = 1, 2, 3, . . . , Nt denotes the number of trials to stack the spectrum and Nt is the total number of
trials. k = 1, 2, 3, . . . , Nm in sHHT corresponds to different IMFs, ck,j , and Nm is the total number of intrinsic
modes for each xj . Compared with HHT, the proposed
method directly calculates the Hilbert spectrum on these
intrinsic modes without an ensemble process,
I
cR
k,j + ick,j ,

k = 1, 2, . . . , Nm ,

Therefore, there are Nm time-frequency realization images for HHT and Nm × Nt time-frequency realization
images for sHHT.
To estimate the deviation of IF measured between the
HHT without the ensemble process and the sHHT, we

Here, µ = λ/∆t, and λ is a factor to count for the amplification over the discretization. No analytical value can

calculate the Hilbert transform of ñ for n to evaluate the

the value λ is estimated to be ≈ 0.63 ± 0.03.

spectrum obtained via EEMD is shown in the top panel, and the
stacked Hilbert spectrum is demonstrated in the bottom panel.

whenever αk,j and βk,j are small enough, and ∆t = 1.
αk,j and βk,j in equation 18 correspond to the imposed
noise to perform sHHT, while the entire process reverts to
the conventional HHT if these two terms vanish. Moreover, Dk − 1 can be treated as the average of all the trials
at the position (t, ωt ) along the frequency axis. Once
we select a great Bk or omit σk2 – indicating that the
additional input noise has a minimal impact – then Dk
approaches unity. This signifies that formula (16) returns
to formula (15), demonstrating the consistency between
the conventional HHT and sHHT methods. The additional noise introduced by sHHT leads to a frequency
dispersion compared to the exact signal in the measurement; nevertheless, the appropriate choice in variance σ 2
and the strength of Bk can only limit deviations to a
small range around the exact IF of the signal. The true
behavior of the exact IF can be further clarified by accumulating a large number of trials, which enhances the
results through a stacked effect. To numerically constrain
the additional input noise level associated with data exhibiting various signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) to track the
exact signal, we also illustrate this correlation in different
signal examples in § III.
In the following section, we will outline the advantages
of the stacked effect when utilizing sHHT. Additionally,
we will highlight the limitations of the HHT in detecting abruptly changing waves within a short timeframe,
specifically regarding the ensemble mean process prior to
time-frequency realization. We have observed that the re-

5
verse process, employing time-frequency realization prior
to the ensemble mean process, is more suitable than the
original or conventional HHT. An example is provided
below. This simulation features a signal that experiences a sudden frequency jump from f = 1 Hz to 2 Hz
at t = 5 s. The signal is represented by the sinusoidal
time series of sin(2πf t) with an SNR of 5, while the SNR
was determined by the ratio of the signal’s amplitude
to the average level of internal noise. Please note that
the simulated signal is given in an arbitrary unit with
amplitude in O(1). We added an external input noise
level of 0.5 to perform sHHT to demonstrate the stacked
effect compared to the EEMD applied in conventional
HHT, and the noise level is universally used to describe
the standard deviation ratio between the time series of
the noise and signal throughout this manuscript. The
results for HHT and sHHT are shown in the top and
bottom panels of Figure 1, respectively. While we understand that the additional input noise influences the
dispersion of the IF, it is evident that the 1 Hz signal,
which appears between 0 and 5 seconds, and the 2 Hz
signal, which appears after 5 seconds, exhibit a flatter
profile when analyzed with the sHHT compared to the
standard HHT. This flattening is attributed to the enhancement provided by the stack effect. Additionally,
the relationship between 1 Hz and 2 Hz is more evident
for sHHT compared to HHT near the point t = 5 s. Based
on the observations above, we conclude that the visualization achieved through sHHT is clearer than that obtained through HHT. In the next section, we will numerically analyze the effectiveness of stacks in sHHT using a
signal with a stationary frequency, as well as linear and
exponential chirp signals.

A.

The time series of the signal is generated by sin(ωt),
where ω = 2πf and f is the frequency of the signal fixed
at 1 Hz. The evolving IF, derived from conventional HHT
and sHHT, is illustrated in the left panel of Fig. 2. The IF
determined by the sHHT method is closer to the actual
frequency of our signal compared to the IF obtained from
the conventional HHT. This comparison shows a clear deviation in the IFs between the traditional method and our
new approach, thus verifying our derivation in the previous section. The right panel of Fig. 2 demonstrates the
spectrum generated by sHHT, and the “stacked” method
enhances the contour level to closely resemble the exact
signal as depicted in the color map.
The left panel of Fig. 3 shows the frequency dispersion
ratio (i.e., the frequency dispersion divided by the actual
frequency) yielded from sHHT for a stable signal that
varied with different SNRs and the imposed noise level.
If we increase the noise level imposed on the signal, we
expect that the frequency dispersion may become larger
as the simulated sample maintains the same SNR. Nevertheless, intriguing variations in dispersion can be observed as the SNR of the signal increases. For instance,
in the left panel of Fig. 3, the dispersion increases when
the SNR of the signal is between 2 and 8 with a low input noise level (i.e., . 0.3). We therefore simulate a time
series with an SNR of 2 and an imposed external noise
level of only 0.01 to be analyzed using sHHT as shown
in the right panel of Fig. 3. Compared to Fig. 2, the
mode mixing problem is more pronounced, even though
the noise level is two orders of magnitude lower in this
new example.

III.

ESTIMATION OF THE FREQUENCY
DISPERSION

We have analytically derived the frequency deviation measured by conventional HHT and our improved
method in the previous section. The effects of this dispersion can be shown through various examples, emphasizing that sHHT is more effective than HHT for tracing
signal evolution. Here we present three examples: stable signals, linear chirp signals, and exponential chirp
signals, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the sHHT
method. Additionally, we investigate how frequency dispersion changes with variations in the SNRs of a dataset
and different levels of external input noise while applying our algorithm. The definition of the SNR and noise
level for the mocked data set is the same as described
in the previous section. The internal and input noise is
assumed to be white Gaussian noise N (0, nσ), where n
denotes the significance of the input noise level.

Stable Sinusoidal Signal

Linear Chirp Signal

In the second example, we examine a signal where the
frequency changes over time. In comparison to other timing methods, the HHT has an advantage in resolving signals of this type. This is because HHT utilizes an adaptive basis that adjusts to variations in the signal, enabling
effective extraction of local information over time. Here
we generate a variable sinusoidal signal sin(ωt), where
ω = 2πf 0 and f 0 is defined as 0.1 · t + 10−3 , evolving
with time (t). The exact frequency (f ) of this signal is
given by the equation 0.2 · t + 10−3 , which is represented
by the blue straight line in the left panel of Fig 4. The
amplitude strength for both the signal and the internal
noise was maintained at a consistent level to simulate
mock data with an SNR of 1, and we arbitrarily introduced external white noise with an amplitude ratio of 0.6
to perform the sHHT. According to the IFs determined
by HHT and sHHT presented in the left panel of Fig. 4,
it is evident that the sHHT performs better in resolving
the signal pattern, even though the boundary problem
remains a challenge. The IF obtained from HHT may
display some spiky peaks in the plot due to the singular-

ity in the calculation; nevertheless, it can be smoothly
moderated by our “stacked” algorithm. The right panel
of Fig. 4 presents the color spectrum of sHHT, and we
can see that the deep color to denote the higher Hilbert
energy accurately corresponds to the actual frequency of
the simulated signal.
To examine the relationship between SNR and imposed
noise level, which affects the frequency dispersion of the
linear chirp signal, we analyze data sets with varying parameters. As shown in the left panel of Fig. 5, the frequency dispersion ratio generally increases when we raise
the imposed noise level or reduce the SNR of our data
sample; however, we also notice some intriguing features
when we focus on cases where the imposed noise level
is less than 1. If we fix the SNR of our dataset in 1,
the ratio of frequency dispersion may decrease when we
increase the imposed noise level. In the right panel of
Fig. 5, the imposed noise level to perform sHHT is fixed
at 0.1, allowing for a comparison with the plot in Fig. 4,
where the noise level is set at 0.6. From this comparison,
it is evident that a higher noise level results in increased
frequency dispersion and more pronounced mode-mixing
issues. We would like to emphasize that this phenomenon
is likely to occur only when the imposed noise level is less
than 1 and when the SNR of the data is between 0.2–1.6.
Otherwise, the frequency dispersion ratio will continue
to increase as the imposed noise level increases.

curately approximates the actual frequency of the signal.
Similar to the linear chirp signal, the frequency dispersion ratio of the exponential chirp signal increases as
the noise level rises and the SNR decreases, particularly
when the input noise level exceeds one. In the left panel
of Fig. 7, we also find that the ratio of frequency dispersion within specific ranges of SNR decreases when we
apply the sHHT while increasing the imposed noise level,
as long as the noise level remains below one. We demonstrate the situation by performing the sHHT with an external noise level of only 0.05 to resolve an exponential
chirp signal with an SNR of 1, as shown in the right panel
of Fig. 7. In comparison to the data set displayed in the
right panel of Fig. 6, the red IF in the right panel of Fig. 7
exhibits a more significant deviation from the blue actual
frequency, although it has an imposed noise level of one
order of magnitude smaller. In our simulation to perform the sHHT, we found that the frequency dispersion
derived from sHHT increases directly with a higher imposed noise level on a lower SNR dataset. However, this
is only true when the external noise level is sufficiently
large (i.e., & 1). Additionally, more severe mode-mixing
issues can still arise in datasets with extremely low imposed noise levels, provided certain special conditions are
met.

Exponential Chirp Signal

The signal pattern of a CBC GW event resembles an
exponential chirp signal characterized by a rapid increase
in frequency. For instance, during the coalescence of two
black holes (BHs), the duration of the whitened waveform, when subjected to a bandpass filter, usually lasts
less than one second. During the merging phase, the
frequency shifts from a few tens of hertz to several thousand hertz in just 0.1 seconds [28]. Although the signal
pattern of a GW event is more complex, we can use an
exponential chirp signal to illustrate it and examine its
characteristics as recognized by HHT and sHHT. Here we
generate an exponential chirp signal using the sinusoidal
function sin(ωt) with ω = 2πf 0 , while f 0 is a function of
time to represent 20.1·t . The actual frequency of such a
signal can be computed by 1/2π · d(ωt)/dt, equivalent to
20.1·t (1 + 0.1 · t · ln 2), which can be illustrated by the blue
curve in Fig. 6. In the generation of linear and exponential chirp signals, we multiply a small coefficient (i.e.,
0.1) to retard the frequency increase, making it easier to
compare with a stable sinusoidal signal; however, in order to match the GW signal, this coefficient can be much
larger. We simulate a time series with SNR = 1 to test
HHT and arbitrarily impose an external noise level = 0.9
to identify the exponential chirp signal using sHHT. IFs
determined by HHT and sHHT are represented by the
black and red curves in the left panel of Fig. 6. As shown
in the right panel, the IF obtained from sHHT more ac-

Comparison with Q-transform

Comparing the investigation of exponential chirp signals between sHHT and the Q-transform is interesting
because such signals behave like GW signals, and the
Q-transform is commonly used for fast scanning. The
Q-transform effectively tracks signals with abrupt frequency changes by allowing the quality factor Q to be
adjusted during computation, enabling the detection of
instant changes in the frequency domain. In the previous section, we added a small exponential factor to
reduce the rate of signal variation in the frequency domain. This modification allows us to compare the results
obtained with the conventional HHT without significant
mode splitting. For such a signal with a frequency change
between 1 and 4 Hz during the first 10 s, the constant Qtransform [5], which closely resembles the Morlet (or Gabor) wavelet [29], can effectively transform our data into
a train of sinusoid Gaussians. Please note that a small
Q factor results in better time resolution but poorer frequency resolution, while a high Q value has the opposite
effect. Therefore, it is important to choose an appropriate Q value when performing the transformation to
balance the visual time and frequency resolutions on the
power spectral map. Our investigation shows that the
method with a fixed Q factor of 10 provides the best visual clarity on the power spectral density map (as shown
by the green contour in the top panel of Fig. 8) compared to other Q factors in the constant Q-transform or
the variable Q-transform.
In contrast to investigating the best relationship be-

APPLICATIONS

HHT is widely applied in many academic and engineering fields, and here we would like to demonstrate its
feasibility in studying the nonlinear signal embedded in
astronomical observations. Because no priori basis is required for such an adaptive method to trace the signal
pattern, HHT was confirmed as a practical algorithm to
investigate the unstable astronomical event (e.g., QPO;
[15], or superorbital modulation; [2, 16, 32]), especially
for the specific GW signal, which can have an immediate change in the frequency domain with a short time
scale (i.e., CBC; [20, 23]). We will present two examples
to demonstrate the practicability of using the sHHT, including investigations into superorbital modulation and
the GW signal. To trace the GW signal, we only include
LIGO data in the following analysis. This is because the
currently known GW events detected by LIGO possess
relatively high SNRs, making them significant enough to

tween the SNR of the data and the imposed noise level for
performing sHHT, we stacked more spectra (i.e., 50000
iterations) here to smooth the distribution of the derived IF for a further check of frequency and time resolutions. Based on our studies in the previous section,
we set the imposed noise amplitude between 0.5 and 1
to ensure a level comparable to the SNR of the data to
minimize the derived frequency deviation, and we overlapped the results obtained from the Q-transform on the
stacked Hilbert spectrum, as presented in Fig. 8. Both
Q-transform generated with a Python-based parameter
estimation toolkit for CBC signals (PyCBC v2.4.0[30];
[31]) and sHHT provide the capability to track signal behavior. For further comparison, we selected six slices at
different times (i.e., 2 s, 5 s, and 8 s) and frequencies (i.e.,
1.5 Hz, 2 Hz, and 2.5 Hz), and this analysis focuses on the
illustration of the related time and frequency resolutions
as shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 8. The full widths
at half maximum for the red and blue profiles to label the
Q-transform and sHHT in the (a) to (c) panels of Fig. 8
are similar, while it shows that the two approaches give a
comparable frequency resolution. We can also find that
the frequency corresponding to the signal resolved by the
Q-transform in the earlier stage is slightly overestimated
(i.e., panel (a)), although it remains within a tolerable
range.

Panels (d) to (f) show that the time resolution of the
sHHT is superior to that of the Q-transform. This is
evident from the narrower full widths at half maximum,
which better constrain the time intervals in the blue profile, even though multiple blue peaks may appear in the
plot. Please note that the top panel of Fig. 8 showcases the optimal visual performance of the Q-transform.
While opting for a smaller Q factor can improve time resolution, it sacrifices frequency resolution, making it more
challenging to track the signal accurately. The multiple
peaks observed in panels (d) to (f), which are also reflected as oscillations in all the resolved signals shown
on the Hilbert spectra, result from intra- or inter-wave
modulations. These modulations are caused by significant variations in the cycle lengths of the intrinsic noise
compared to the exact signal. This effect is particularly
pronounced when we impose a noise level comparable to
the SNR of the datasets to perform sHHT, and it is expected to moderate this effect once we implement the
zero-crossing algorithm in the sHHT method. We note
that the frequency change in this simulation occurs at a
much slower rate compared to a real CBC signal during
the merging phase, suggesting that the Q-transform (or
wavelet method) still has advantages in accurately tracking the evolution of such a signal, but these oscillations
can be ignored once the ratio of their amplitude to the
entire rapid frequency changes is small.

be recognized in the dynamic power spectra.
In general, we had no information on the SNR for one
dataset, even though we quantitatively constrained the
relationship between it and the required external noise
level to perform sHHT, leading to the least dispersion in
IF in § III. Please note that the conventional method to
determine the network SNR of a GW event is through
the matched filtering algorithm [33]. This approach differs from the simpler definition of SNR, which is based on
the amplitude ratio between the signal and the noise, as
universally applied throughout this manuscript. Without information about the strength of the internal noise
embedded in a dataset, we can only blindly check the
external noise level required to generate an acceptable
stacked Hilbert spectrum. Typically, this external noise
level is set between 0.01 and 10 to multiply the standard
deviation of the time series. If the noise level incorporated is significantly smaller than the intrinsic noise of
the data, the mode-mixing problem persists, resulting in
several unphysical features on the stacked Hilbert spectrum. Conversely, the true signal in the Hilbert spectra can be obscured by the significant external noise involved in executing the sHHT. The best external noise
level incorporated to perform sHHT can be determined
after a series of investigations on the obtained stacked
Hilbert spectrum, and this algorithm is definitely more
time-consuming than other dynamical timing methods.
Since the current known GW events with low SNRs (. 8,
determined by matched filtering) cannot provide a clear
image of the time-frequency representation and the signal is only sensitive to the correlation with a theoretical
template, we therefore only demonstrate the GW signals
recorded by two LIGO detectors in § IV.B.

minimizing the potential spurious frequency variability,
as demonstrated in Fig. 9b and Hu et al. [4].

Akhshi et al. [20] used the conventional HHT as the
basis to develop a template-free approach to extract the
GW signal, and they derive the physical time delays between the arrivals of GWs at different detector locations
by analyzing the waveforms given by the HHT. However, the GW signal pattern obtained from the conventional HHT has a serious mode-mixing problem, especially when the EEMD was not employed in the related
investigations. In addition to the conventional HHT,
sHHT has demonstrated its feasibility to investigate the
GW from the CBC and a burst-typed event with a better
performance [22].
We would like to provide additional examples to
demonstrate the feasibility of sHHT in investigating confident GW events using the open data obtained from the
O3 observing run of L-V-K-GEO [35], which were not
included in Hu et al. [22]. We obtain the 32 s LIGO data
of 4k Hz released from the GW Open Science Center[36].
Both data sets recorded at the Hanford and Livingston
sites are included in our analysis. The GW data are the
time series to record a long-term strain variation with
a peak intensity of ∼ 10−21 , and therefore, the serious
contamination of the colored noise or line features from
instruments and background can be seen from the sim-

The HHT has been successfully used to monitor the
superorbital modulation of SMC X-1, as reported in Hu
et al. [32]. The modulation period varies between approximately 35 to 70 days, which is just below a factor of
2. The EEMD, which is a dyadic filter, can decompose
the superorbital modulation signal into a single IMF that
facilitates the calculation of the instantaneous frequency.
However, the modulation period has evolved to a shorter
regime, which challenges the tracking of the superorbital
frequency during the latest “excursion” event, identified
by a reduction in the superorbital modulation period to
45 days or less (around MJD 54000, 57200, and 59200
in Figure 9). The light curve data applied to generate
the figure were obtained from the hard X-ray monitoring program using the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory
[34]. To maintain the modulation within a single IMF, it
becomes necessary to incorporate a significant amount
of noise when performing the EEMD. This results in
further fluctuations in the instantaneous frequency, as
shown in Fig. 9a, contrasting with Fig. 3 in Hu et al.
[32]. On the other hand, the sHHT provides a more dis-

ple Fourier transform. The effective frequency range of
the current L-V-K-GEO data is restricted from 30 Hz to
a few hundred Hz, depending on different interferometers [37, 38], and we can only search for GW signals
of specific origins in this frequency band. To mitigate
the effects of colored noise and spectral lines caused by
instruments and background, we followed the standard
procedure to whiten the data using a Python-based GW
analysis library(GWPY v3.0.8[39]; [40]). This process is
intended to normalize power across all frequencies and
enhance higher-frequency content. The whitening process was performed using a fast Fourier transform integration lasting 4 s, with a 2 s window overlap for Hann
smoothing. We concentrate on the frequency range of
30–500 Hz in our analysis of LIGO data since the noise
is high in the low- and high-frequency ends.
To decide the optimal external noise level incorporated to perform the sHHT, we blindly consider different input noise levels within 0.01–10 as one example provided in Appendix A, and pick up the value to
achieve the best visual performance. We finally impose the external noise levels of 0.6 and 0.8 to generate the Hilbert spectra of GW200129 065458 measured
by Handford and Livingston detectors, respectively. For
GW190814, we incorporate the external noise level of 0.9
to perform the sHHT on the data obtained from both
detectors. As shown in Fig. 10, we present the stacked

Hilbert spectra of GW200129 065458 and GW190814
[41]. GW200129 065458 is a significant event with a high
network SNR (26.8 ± 0.2) inferred from the IMRPhenomXPHM model; [42]), and it was recorded in the GW
Transient Catalog-3 (GWTC-3; [43]) with detection in all
three detectors including Virgo. This event is supposed
to be a binary BH merger with a mass of approximately
∼ 35 M and ∼ 29 M , but the SEOBNRv4PHM template [44] indicates a preference for a merger with nearly
equal masses, with a mass ratio of q ∼ 0.9. In addition, there is weak evidence of precession, characterized
by χp ∼ 0.36. Due to the data quality issues identified
in the Livingston dataset as mentioned in Abbott et al.
[43], only the GstLAL pipeline [45] is considered for its
trigger. This analysis yields a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the Livingston data (i.e., 21.2) compared
to the Hanford data (i.e., 14.6) and the Virgo data (i.e.,
6.3). By the sHHT, we can clearly observe signal patterns for GW200129 065458 in the upper panel of Fig. 10
while the power (i.e., Hilbert energy) accumulated in the
Hilbert spectra for the Livingston data is also more substantial, aligning with the results provided by the GstLAL pipeline.
Compared to generating a GW template for merging
binary BHs, the amplitude of NS mergers is considerably
lower, and the coherent signal can persist for a much
longer duration during the inspiral phase. According to

12
Hu et al. [22], the time-frequency characteristics of a coalescing binary NSs event near the merging phase are
smeared due to the wide Gaussian window, and the SNR
is insufficient within this large window to accurately identify the intrinsic time-frequency properties of the signal.
The wavelet method can present the signal more clearly
because we can tune the Gaussian envelope’s parameter
to one order smaller than the value used to examine the
event of binary BH mergers. Except for the coalescence
of two NSs, we notice that the GW template corresponding to the coalescence of a BH and an NS or a lower mass
gap (i.e., 2.5 – 5 M ; [46, 47]) can also have a longer coherence time. We therefore select the GW190814, categorized as a BH-NS (with the secondary mass < 3 M ) in
GWTC-2.1 [48], as our second example. This GW event
is supposed to be caused by the merger of ∼ 23.3 M
black hole and ∼ 2.6 M lower mass gap inferred from
a set of posterior samples drawn with equal weight from
the IMRPhenomXPHM [42] and SEOBNRv4PHM [44]
analyses. We want to clarify that the Hanford interferometer was out of observation mode during the trigger
time of GW190814. However, the strain dataset was still
collected and carefully calibrated by the detector characterization team to identify useful time intervals for public
release. In our analysis, we also examine the sHHT using
the Hanford data as shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 10.
The significance of the signal pattern is weaker than the
performance shown for the Livingston data; however, its
signal identification is still stronger than the GW170817
(NS-NS event; [49]) presented in Hu et al. [22]. The interwave modulation can be seen in the inspiral phase in
the low-frequency range on the time-frequency map, and
it is expected to improve if we use the zero-crossing algorithm in sHHT, which is not supported in the current
EMD package in Python (emd v0.6.2[50]; [51]).

We note that the waveform models including higherorder multipoles (HMs, e.g., IMRPhenomXPHM [42] and
SEOBNRv4PHM [44]) were used to provide more precise measurements of the parameters for a CBC event,
while the importance of a subdominant multipole moment increases with the mass ratio. GW190814 was detected with strong evidence of HMs [41] affecting the network SNR, and the coherent Wave-Burst pipeline, which
was constructed based on minimally modeled burst algorithms [52, 53], can identify HMs through the timefrequency representation by detecting coherent excess
power in the chirp-like regions that correspond to various
HMs [54]. In Fig. 11, we use the SEOBNRv4PHM ROM
template to approximate the waveform of GW190814
with the dominant (l,|m|) = (2,2) quadrupole and the
(l,|m|) = (3,3) subdomaint multipole and overlapped
their IFs on the stacked Hilbert spectrum of the same
event detected from the Livingston detector. Because the
IF of the generic multipole (l,|m|) can be approximated
to a scaled version of the dominant (2,2) quadrupole, we
can examine the generic HM gravitational radiation with
the following IF dependence [55, 56].
fl,|m| (t) ≈

|m|
f22 (t) ≈ α0 f22 (t)
2

(26)

α0 is a dimensionless parameter, which allows us to constrain a range on the time-frequency map to investigate
the residual power/energy of a specific multipole’s IF
along the time-frequency track. The green dashed curves
in Fig. 11 label the time-frequency slice corresponding to
[α0 − 0.1, α0 + 0.1]×f22 (t) with α0 = 1.5 of (3,3) multipole. We can find significant energy/power excesses close
to 0.2 and 0.4 s before the merger time constrained in the
above region shown in the stacked Hilbert spectrum, and
it is consistent with the feature presented by the discrete
Wilson–Daubechies–Meyer wavelet transform [57]. Similar features obtained from sHHT on the time-frequency
representation are expected to further yield a similar result in the waveform-agnostic approach [54] to provide
evidence for the presence of HM. Please note that the
time resolution for generating the stacked Hilbert spectrum aligns with the sampling rate (4k) of the data, enabling the capability for more precise measurements between different phases. Further quantitative assessment
to examine the HM GW radiation using sHHT could be
an interesting work in future development.

CONCLUSION

In this study, we have introduced the analytical properties of the sHHT, a novel improvement over the traditional HHT for time-frequency analysis, and evaluated its applicability using simulated signals and real
data. Through a series of numerical simulations, we have
demonstrated that sHHT can effectively capture signals
experiencing rapid frequency changes (the relevant codes
can be referred to github[58]). This is commonly seen

13
in GW signals associated with CBCs and other bursttype events [22]. Our exploration has shown that the
sHHT method greatly enhances the accuracy of tracing
these signals compared to the conventional HHT, especially in instances of mode-mixing issues. We notice that
the intra- or inter-wave modulations caused by the intrinsic noise within the data may produce the oscillation
features on the time-frequency representation, and this
can be confirmed by analyzing a pure signal using the
sHHT method (details in Appendix B). While these oscillation features can become somewhat smeared when
we consume more time to accumulate the Hilbert spectra, they cannot be completely eliminated. Nevertheless,
the related effect is minor when we track a signal crossing
over a wide frequency range within a short time interval.
Similar to the HHT, the sHHT, a template-free
method, does not require the imposition of a priori basis
sets on the data. Therefore, the sHHT offers an adaptive approach to time-frequency analysis, making sHHT
suitable for analyzing non-stationary signals. We have
explored the frequency dispersion through examples of
stationary sinusoidal, linear chirp, and exponential chirp
signals. Our analysis reveals how the frequency dispersion evolves with changes in SNRs, highlighting the sensitivity of sHHT to these factors. By the investigation of
simulations, we recommend incorporating an additional
noise with a level between 0.5 and 1 times the standard
deviation of the signal strength to perform this approach.
Moreover, our application of sHHT to real astronomical
data, including the superorbital modulation of SMC X-1
and the signals from confirmed GW events, further highlights its capability to extract meaningful physical insights. The aforementioned external noise level between
0.5 – 1 is also suitable to generate the stacked Hilbert
spectrum of most known GW events. These results point
out the potential of sHHT to serve as a powerful tool in
the field of astrophysics and beyond, given the growing
importance of the complexity of the signals observed in
the multi-messenger era. For example, it will be remarkable to further quantitatively assess the GW events including HMs to compare with Wilson–Daubechies–Meyer
wavelet transform [57] in the future.

Appendix A: Different input noise levels imposed on
the real GW data

Since we have no information about the SNR of one
GW whitened data in the beginning, the optimal noise
level incorporated to perform the sHHT can only be decided from a range (i.e., 0.01–10) with a repeated investigation on the visual performance of the results. We
created a random time series by multiplying the external
noise level and the dataset’s standard deviation (amplitude). This time series was then imposed on the original
data to perform sHHT. Here we present all the stacked
Hilbert spectra of the Livingston data generated with different external noise levels (Fig. 12) as references. Please
note that the contour level of each plot in Fig. 12 is flexibly adjusted to highlight the real signal. Results indicate
that the mode-mixing phenomenon remains significant,
and the Hilbert spectrum is heavily influenced by intrinsic/internal noise when the incorporated noise level is
too low. On the contrary, the real signal on the Hilbert
spectra can be smeared by the strong external noise incorporated to perform the sHHT.

FIG. 13. Pure exponential chirp signal the same as Fig. 4 resolved by the sHHT method. The stacked Hilbert spectrum was obtained
with the incorporation of the external noise of 0.5 in the left panel and of 0.05 in the right panel. The blue curve shows the actual signal
frequency, and the red curves in both panels represent the IF determined by the sHHT, accumulated 10000 times. The green contour
exhibits the different Hilbert energy levels on the stacked Hilbert spectra.

Appendix B: Different input noise levels imposed on
the pure signal

In order to confirm whether the oscillation modulations
shown on the stacked Hilbert spectra are caused by the

internal noise of the data, we directly apply the sHHT to
investigate the pure exponential chirp signal described in
§ III.C. Fig. 13 presents the results yielded with different
input noise levels to conduct the sHHT. Compared with

15
the stacked Hilbert spectra shown in Figs. 6 and 7, the
contour to denote the signal behavior is almost uniformly
distributed along the actual blue signals. For the IFs determined in two plots of Fig. 13, we can still see minor
oscillations because we incorporate the external noise to
perform the sHHT, and it also reflects on the wavy artifacts of the contours. We notice that the oscillation of
IF in the left panel is visually more significant than that
shown in the right panel of Fig 13 because the external

noise level applied to perform the sHHT is one order of
magnitude stronger. We therefore conclude that the oscillation features shown on the stacked Hilbert spectra
are led by the intrinsic noises embedded inside the data,
which cause significant intra- or inter-wave modulations
to determine the IF. The external noise incorporated to
perform the sHHT can also lead to a similar minor effect, and to pick up the proper noise level is important
to investigate a stationary signal with sHHT.
