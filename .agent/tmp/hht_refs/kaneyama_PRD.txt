Using the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), we analyze gravitational waves from late-inspiral,
merger, and post-merger phases of binary neutron stars coalescence, computed by a general relativistic numerical simulation. The HHT analysis has been developed as a novel method for time
series analysis of nonlinear and non-stationary data and it enables us to perform a high resolution
time-frequency analysis of signals with strong frequency modulation, by evaluating the instantaneous variation of amplitude and frequency of data. It is found that temporal variation of frequency
of post-merger waveforms can be evaluated within 5 % error if BNS coalescences occur within 10
Mpc. This accuracy allows us to constrain the equation of state of neutron stars and to evaluate
the radius of a fiducial neutron star of 1.8M⊙ with ∼ 1 km accuracy.

INTRODUCTION

The coalescence of binary neutron stars (BNSs) is
one of the most promising sources for the groundbased gravitational wave detectors, such as Advanced LIGO [1], Advanced Virgo [2] and KAGRA [3]. The observation of gravitational waves
(GWs) from the coalescence of BNSs will lead to
constraining the equation of state (EOS) of the neutron stars (NSs) and examining the hypothesis of
the central engine of short γ-ray bursts. The detection rate of such events for the ground-based gravitational wave detectors is estimated to be 4-400 yr−1
by theoretical and statistical studies [4].
The EOS of high-density nuclear matter for NSs
is still poorly known. Under assumptions that a NS
is in cold, spherically symmetric, general relativistic, hydrostatistic equilibrium, there is one-to-one
correspondence between the EOS and mass-radius
relation of NSs [5]. Therefore, the EOS will be constrained, if the mass and radius of NSs are evaluated
through the observation of GWs from coalescences
of BNS.
Many hypothetical EOSs have been proposed from
the theoretical study of nuclear physics. Each EOS
is characterized by the maximum mass of neutron stars. Recently, NSs of high mass such as
1.97 ± 0.04M⊙ [6] and 2.01 ± 0.04M⊙ [7] were discove through electromagnetic observations. These
discoveries suggest that the EOS of NSs must predict the maximum mass greater than 2M⊙ .
Recently, the gravitational waveforms from the
coalescences of BNS and dynamics of post-merger
phase have been explored in detail by general rela-

tivistic numerical simulations (e.g., [8–13]). These
gravitational waveforms reflects mass and the EOS
of NSs as well as the dynamics of the BNS merger [8–
13]. A black hole is promptly formed after the coalescences for soft EOSs or for high-mass BNS, while
a massive neutron star (MNS) is formed after the
coalescences for stiﬀ EOSs or for low-mass BNS. We
note that the mass of MNS can be heavier than the
maximum mass of spherical NSs, since MNSs formed
after the coalescences are supported by thermal pressure and the centrifugal force resulting from rapid
and diﬀerential rotation.
Previous studies [10–12] have suggested the possible presence of a relation between the radius of a
fiducial NS and the peak frequency in the Fourier
spectrum of GWs from MNSs. Thus if we can determine the peak frequency of GWs, the radii of a
fiducial NS will be constrained, leading to a strong
constraint of the EOS of NSs. This information allow us to constrain the EOS of NSs.
The Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), which consists of an empirical mode decomposition followed by
the Hilbert spectral analysis, have been developed
recently by Huang et al. [14–16]. Compared with
the Fourier decomposition and wavelet decomposition, the empirical mode decomposition approach
has an advantage for analyzing the non-stationary
and non-linear data since it decomposes the signal
into intrinsic mode functions based on the time scale
of the signal itself with adaptive nature. The HHT is
not limited by time-frequency uncertainty and thus
it provides a high resolution time-frequency analysis.
The HHT is a promising powerful tool to extract
the informations from the gravitational waveforms.

2
Applications of the HHT to the data analysis of
GWs, mainly from burst sources including supernovae and coalescence of supermassive black holes,
have already been proposed in Refs. [17–22]. It could
also be a powerful tool for analyzing GWs from
the BNS coalescences, in particular for the merger
and post-merger phases. Thus, in this paper, we
describe a method for analyzing GWs from lateinspiral, merger, and post-merger phases of BNSs
using the HHT.
The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we
briefly review the Hilbert-Huang transform. In Sec.
III, we briefly describe the numerical waveforms that
we employ in this paper. In Sec. IV, the results of
the HHT analysis are shown and the implication of
the results is discussed. In Sec. V, we discuss the
accuracy of derived instantaneous frequency of GWs
from MNS. Section VI is devoted to a summary.

II.

(B) At any data point, the mean values of the upper and the lower envelopes defined by using
the local maxima and minima, respectively,
have to be zero.
These empirical conditions indicate that the data
have a vertical symmetry around zero point. However, the observational data s(t) do not generally
satisfy these conditions. Thus the observational data
s(t) should be decomposed by using the EMD. When
using the EMD, we implicitly assume that, at any
given time, the data may have many coexisting oscillatory modes of significantly diﬀerent frequencies,
one superimposed on the other. For each of these
modes, we define an IMF that satisfies the IMF condition. With the definition of the IMF, we can thus
decompose any data through the EMD, which, in a
sense, is a sifting process using a series of high-pass
filters. The outline of this algorithm is summarized
as follows and Fig. 1 shows a schematic example of
this procedure.

THE HILBERT-HUANG TRANSFORM

Algorithm Empirical Mode Decompotion (EMD)
In this section, we briefly review the HHT. The
HHT analysis consists of two parts. The first one
is the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), in
which the time series data are decomposed into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). This is just a preconditioning for the next step. In the second part of
the HHT, the Hilbert transform is applied to each
IMF, and we obtain an analytic complex representation of each IMF. From this, we derive the instantaneous frequency (IF) and the instantaneous amplitude (IA) of each IMF. This part is called the Hilbert
spectrum analysis (HSA). The IF and IA provide a
time-frequency representation of data that is wellsuited for resolving nonlinear and transient feature
of the original data.
We assume that the input s(t) is given by sampling
a continuous signal at discrete time series, tj = j∆t
for j = 0, 1, · · · , N − 1, where N is the number of
data points and ∆t is the sampling interval.

Empirical Mode Decomposition

For any time-series data, it is known that the
Hilbert transform of the data does not always yield
physically meaningful results. Huang et al. [15]
showed that the IA and IF have physically meaningful results, if the time-series data satisfy the following conditions (hereinafter referred to as the IMF
condition):
(A) For all data sets, the number of extrema and
the number of zero crossings have to either be
identical or diﬀer at most by one.

Note1: The decomposition completes when si (t) becomes monotonic or has only one extremum.

The above procedures are summarized as follows.
In the beginning, we set g(t) = s1 (t) = s(t), using
the original data. Then the EMD procedure is performed identifying all the local extrema (Fig. 1a).

gradually decreases in each step.

The local maxima and minima are connected by cubic splines to form the upper envelope U (t) and the
lower envelope L(t), respectively (Fig. 1b). All data
are usually encompassed between them. Let their
mean m(t) = (U (t) + L(t))/2 and update g(t) by
subtracting it from g(t) to obtain the first protomode; g(t) = g(t) − m(t) (Fig. 1c). The mean m(t)
contains the DC oﬀset and componets in a low frequency band of the signal, and therefore g(t) is expected to satisfy the IMF condition. However, that
is usually not the case, but iteration of the above
procedure is necessary if g(t) still contains two or
more oscillatory componets. Finally, g(t) becomes
the IMF1, c1 (t) = g(t), if the IMF condition is satisfied approximately after several iterations (Fig. 1d).
In practice, these conditions are not satisfied precisely. Thus, we have to define an approximate criterion for stopping the interaction procedure. This
is controlled by a stoppage criterion. Several diﬀerent types of stoppage criteria have been adopted. In
this paper, we use a criterion determined by using
the Cauchy type of convergence test, which was used
in [15]:

with a predetermined value ϵ.
The first IMF1 c1 (t) should contain the finest scale
or the shortest-period oscillation in the signal. It
will be subtracted from the original data to obtain
the residual s2 (t) = s1 (t) − c1 (t), which contains
the longer-period oscillations. It is then treated as a
new data source and subject to the same process of

EMD as described above to obtain the IMF of the
next lowest frequency.
The procedure is iteratively applied to all subsequent si (t). The decomposition process finally stops
when the residual, sn+1 (t), becomes monotonic or
has only one extremum, from which no more IMF
can be extracted. Then the original data are decomposed into
∑n n IMFs and a residue, r(t) = sn+1 (t);
s(t) =
i=1 ci (t) + r(t). The residue r(t) can be
either the adaptive local median or trend. In practice, numerical errors occasionally prevent the residual sn+1 (t) from being monotonic and thus the decomposition process is ceased if the residual becomes
much smaller than previous IMFs.

2.

Ensemble empirical mode decomposition

In the original form of EMD, however, mode mixing often occurs when either a single IMF consists of
signals of widely disparate scales, or when signals of
a similar scale reside in diﬀerent IMF components.
To mitigate this eﬀect, Wu and Huang [23] proposed
ensemble EMD (EEMD), which defines the true IMF
components as the mean of an ensemble of trials,
each consisting of the signal plus a white (Gaussian)
noise of finite standard deviation (finite amplitude).
The EEMD algorithm is composed of the following
steps:
(i) Add a white (Gaussian) noise with the standard deviation σe to the orignal data s(t).
(ii) Decompose the data with the white noise into
IMFs.

4
(iii) Repeat steps (i) and (ii) for several times but
with a diﬀerent white Gaussian noise series at
each time.
(iv) Obtain the ensemble means for the series of
the obtained IMFs of the decompositions. The
number of trials, Ne , has to be larger than 100.
In the algorithm of EMD/EEMD, some predeterminant parameters such as ϵ, σe and Ne exist.
The method of setting the parameters is discussed
in [20]. The EMD/EEMD parameters are used in
this paper will be shown in Table II.

Hilbert Spectral Analysis

The HHT can provide a time-frequency-energy
paradigm of data. In this approach, the nonlinearity and nonstationarity can be extracted in a better
manner than in the traditional paradigm of constant
frequency and amplitude. For instance, the nonstationarity can be found directly from the IF and IA
(see below). This is the reason that the Hilbert Spectral Analysis (HSA) was included as a part of the
HHT.
The Hilbert transform of a function u(t) is defined
as

where P and ∗ denote taking the Cauchy principal
value of the singular integral and the convolution, respectively. If a function u(t) belongs to the Lebesgue
space Lp for 1 < p < ∞, the Hilbert transform is
well-defined and g(t) = u(t) + iv(t) is the boundary
value of a holomorphic function g(z) = a(z)eiθ(z)
in the upper half-plane [24, 25]. Then the instantaneous amplitude Ainst (t), and the instantaneous
phase function θinst (t) are defined by

We emphasize that the meaning of the IF, which is
a function of time, is very diﬀerent from that of the
Fourier frequency, which is constant by definition.
Indeed, as the IF is a continuous function, it can
reflect a modulation of a base frequency over a small
fraction of the base wave cycle.
Through EMD/EEMD, we obtain the IMFs ci (t)
(real part). From Eq.(2), we can obtain the imaginary part, or the conjugate function, of each ci (t).

Therefore, the HSA derives Ainst,i (t) and Finst,i (t),
of each IMF ci (t). Through this procedure, the HHT
to allows extract instantaneous time-frequency and
time-amplitude trajectories. This time-frequencyamplitude map (HHT map) allows for a high resolution time-frequency analysis of waveforms with
strong frequency modulation.

SETUP FOR SIMULATION

In this section, we explain the setup for our data
analysis simulation. We prepare the simulated timeseries data of Advanced LIGO by combining Gaussian noise with a gravitational waveform from lateinspiral, merger, and post-merger phases of BNS
computed by numerical-relativity simulations.

A.

Gravitational waveform from late-inspiral,
merger and post-merger phase of BNS

We choose 5 gravitational waveforms computed
by Sekiguchi et al. [9, 27]. These gravitational
waveform were computed for NSs of two finitetemperature EOSs: EOS including contributions of
Λ hyperons (Hyp-EOS) [26] and a purely nucleonic EOS (Shen-EOS). The maximum masses of
zero-temperature spherical NSs for Hyp-EOS and
Shen-EOS are Mmax,Hyp ≃ 1.8M⊙ and Mmax,Shen ≃
2.2M⊙ , respectively. Gravitational waveforms were
computed only for symmetric binaries with MNS ≡
M1 = M2 = 1.35M⊙ and 1.5M⊙ for Hyp-EOS (refered to as H135 and H15) and Shen-EOS (S135 and
S15), and MNS = 1.6M⊙ for Shen-EOS (S16). The
parameters of the models used in this paper are
shown in Table I.
The waveforms consist of three parts: the late
inspiral waveform, the merger waveform, and the
post merger waveform. Gravitational waves from the
late inspiral phase are essentially identical with each
other for the models with Hyp-EOS and Shen-EOS
for the same mass. The waveforms in the merger and
post-merger phases depends strongly on the total
mass of binaries and the EOS. For all models used in
this paper, a MNS is formed and the quasi-periodic
gravitational waves from the remnant MNS are emit-

5
ted. Since the MNSs collapse to a black hole before
relaxing to a stationary spheroid, the amplitude of
quasi-periodic gravitational waves damps steeply at
the black hole formation for H135 and H15. The
frequency of gravitational wave increases with time
for H135 and H15 (Hyp-EOS models) [9], while it
is approximately constant (around 2 kHz) for S135,
S15 and S16 (Shen-EOS).
Detailed description of general relativistic numerical simulations and gravitational waveforms used in
this paper are found in [9, 27].

Simulation data

We use the simulated time-series noise data of
Advanced LIGO. With a sensitivity curve of Advanced LIGO (the zero-detuned, high-power sensitivity curve [28]), we produce the simulated Gaussian noise in frequency domain. The sampling frequency is set to fs = 1/∆t = 16384Hz and the
frequency range of the detector noise is set to be
from 20 Hz to 8182 Hz. Time-series noise data, n(t),
is produced by the inverse Fourier transform of the
simulated noise in frequency domain.
The hypothetical observational data s(t) is produced by injecting the GW signal h(t) into the Gausian noise n(t); s(t) = h(t) + n(t), where h(t) can
be expressed in terms of antenna pattern functions
F+ (⃗es (t)) and F× (⃗es (t)), which depend on the direction of the source ⃗es (t) = (θs (t), ϕs (t)), as well
as polarizations components h+ (t) and h× (t) of the
GWs as
h(t) = F+ (⃗es (t))h+ (t) + F× (⃗es (t))h× (t).

(6)

In this paper, we set F+ (⃗es ) = 1 and F× (⃗es ) = 0,
for simplicity. Figure 2 shows an example of data
s(t), where the H135 GW signal at a hypothetical
distance of 5 Mpc is injected into the simulated timeseries noise data of Advanced LIGO.

RESULTS OF HHT

In this section, we present the results of HHT analysis of the simulation data described in Sec.III.

A.

IMF, IA and IF

First, we apply the EEMD to each data set with
the signal described in Sec.III B. For each of IMFs,
we compute the IA and IF with HSA.
The values of EEMD parameters, which were discussed in Sec.II A 2, are summarized in Table II.
In Fig.3, we show the results of HHT for the H135
GW signal at a hypothetical distance of 5 Mpc injected in Advanced LIGO noise. In this case, the
data is decomposed into 8 IMFs, but those only
from IMF1 to IMF6 are plotted, since it is clear that
no GW signal is included in IMF7 and IMF8. The
upper panel in each figure box shows ci (t) as the
red curve and the injected signal as the dashed blue
curve. The IA is plotted in the middle panel of each
figure box, while the bottom panel shows the IF as
the red curve, and the frequency of the injected signal as the dashed blue curve.
From this figure it is recognized that the IFs of
IMF4 and IMF5, Finst,4 and Finst,5 , clearly capture
the frequency modulation in the late-inspiral phase
from −8 ms to 0 ms, even though the signal is split
into two IMFs and each IA, Ainst,4 and Ainst,5 , is
therefore smaller than the amplitude of the injected
signal. The signal during this phase will be reconstructed more closely by adding the IMF4 and IMF5
together. Signals with frequency band of 500 Hz or
below would appear in IMF6 and higher IMFs, if we
used a longer-term waveform including earlier inspiral components. A significant decrease in Ainst,4 is
observed at t = tmerge and thus we may determine
the merger time with reasonable accuracy. In any
case, however, the matched filter method should attain higher accuracy than HHT for analysis of chirp
signals in the inspiral phase.
IMF3 from 0 ms to 10 ms, on the other hand,
captures the signal emitted from the MNS formed
after the merger, while some portion of the signal
is allotted to IMF2, especially in the later stage.
The IF of IMF3, Finst,3 , agrees substantially with
that of the injected signal. However, Finst,3 stays in
the same frequency band even after the black hole

FIG. 3. A result of HHT. GW signal H135 at a hypothetical distance of 5 Mpc injected in Advanced LIGO noise is
used. The upper panel in each figure box shows the IMF ci (t) (red curve) as well as the injected H135 waveform
(dashed blue curve). The middle panel shows the IA of corresponding IMF. The bottom panel shows the IF of the
corresponding IMF (red curve) as well as the frequency of injected signal (dashed blue curve).

formation. During this period, IMF3 captures the
noise in that frequency band. As for the IA, Ainst,3
is decreases gradually even before the black hole formation. Therefore it is diﬃcult for the HHT to determine when the black hole is formed.
Based on the obtained IFs and IAs, we plot the
time-frequency-amplitude map, which we call the
HHT map, in the left of Fig. fig:tfmap. In this figure, we use the time resolution ∆t = 1/16384 s and
frequency resolution ∆f = 20 Hz, respectively. The
frequency evolution can be seen clearly and it agrees
approximately with that of the injected signal.
We show the HHT map and its enlargement for
S15 in the right of Fig.4. We also plot the Finst,3 in

the post-merger phase for H135 and S15 as functions
of time in Fig.5.

As already pointed out in [9] and discussed in
Sec.III A, the frequency of GWs from MNS increases
with time for Hyp-EOS, while the frequency is approximately constant (besides a periodic oscillation)
for Shen-EOS. Fig.5 indeed shows that the IF of
H135 increases overall until 10 ms, while the IFs of
S15 is essentially constant until 12 ms, when a black
hole is formed. We may therefore distinguish the difference of the frequency evolution between Hyp-EOS
models and Shen-EOS models.

Statistical error

Since we generate the detector noise n(t) with a
Gaussian random variate, the results of the analysis
will be changed even for the same injected signal, if a
diﬀerent seed of random numbers is used. Since the
(E)EMD is a data-driven decomposition method, the
results of the HHT may be aﬀected by the diﬀerent
realization of noise. Therefore, we investigate the
statistical property of the results of the HHT. We
perform the HHT for 1000 samples, each of which
is generated by adding a Gaussian random variate
with a diﬀerent seed.

The result for H135 signal at a hypothetical distance of 5 Mpc is shown in Fig.6. Each of top panels
shows the mean value of the IA for corresponding
IMF as the red curve and it’s standard deviation
(±1σ) as the green shaded region. In each of bottom panels, we plot the mean value of the IF (red
curve) for corresponding IMF, it’s standard deviation (±1σ) (green shaded region) as well as the frequency of the injected signal (dashed blue curve),
which is computed from h+ (t) and h× (t) obtained
by numerical-relativity simulations.
We find that the standard deviation of the IF is
smaller in the period when the IA of the corresponding IMF is larger. We also find that the Finst,3 from
0 ms to 10 ms agrees with the frequency of FWs emitted after the merger very well. Similarly, the Finst,4
from −10 ms to 0 ms agrees with the frequency of
GWs emitted in the late inspiral and the IF of Finst,5
from −10 ms to −5 ms agrees with the frequency of
the first half of the late inspiral. On the other hand,
the standard deviation of the IF of each IMF are
large when there exists only noise.
For other injected signals given in Table I, we generally obtained the similar results to those discussed
in Sec. IV A and Sec.IV B.

tween Hyp-EOS models and Shen-EOS models. In
this subsection, we characterize the frequency evolution by using the linear regression.
We make the linear regression for Finst,3 using the
least squares method with weights :
(7)

with the fitting time range from 3 ms to 11 ms for
H135 and from 3 ms to 12 ms for S15, respectively.
The coeﬃcient of β1 and β2 are the intercept and
gradient, respectively. The frequency evolution are
characterized with the gradient β2 .
Using the results in Sec. IV B, we perform the fitting to evaluate the coeﬃcient β2 from 1000 samples. Fig.7 shows the distribution of β2 for H135
(purple region) and S15 (green region). The mean
and the standard deviation of β2 become: (40.3 ±
18.7) Hz/ms for H135 and (5.4 ± 12.2) Hz/ms for
S15. From these results, we can confirm that Finst,3
increases with time for H135, while Finst,3 is approximately constant for S15. This fact suggests the possibility that we can distinguish the EOS from the
evolution of the IF of MNS by using the HHT analysis. Note, however, that since the distribution of β2

ACCURACY OF THE FREQUENCY
EVOLUTION

Now we focus on the GWs emitted in the merger
and post-merger phases. A MNS is formed after the
merger for the models considered in this paper. We
now examine how accurately we can measure the
GW frequency from MNS with the HHT.
In order to evaluate the measurement accuracy of
the IF of GWs from MNS, we define [20]

where Fsignal (t) is the frequency of the injected signal.
We evaluate δ by using the IF and IA of IMF c2 or
c3 for each model listed in Table I. In Table III, we
show the mean value of δ and the standard deviation
for an event at a distance of 10 Mpc. The mean
values and the standard deviation of δ are plotted
as functions of the source distance in Fig.8.
We find that if the time duration of quasi-periodic
GWs emitted from the MNS is long enough, the frequency modulation can be evaluated with good accuracy for Hyp-EOS and Shen-EOS cases. For example, although for H15, δ is about 30% at 10 Mpc, δ
is less than 5% for other models. This diﬀerence can
be explained from the duration of the quasi-periodic
GWs emitted from MNS in Table I.
In the previous study [12], the relation between
the peak frequency of the Fourier spectrum fpeak and
the radius parameter R1.8 , which is the radius of a
cold, spherical neutron star of mass 1.8M⊙ in general
relativistic hydrostatic equilibrium, was discussed.

The peak frequency fpeak can be evaluated from
the time integration of the IF. For models other than
H15, since δ is the square-sum of diﬀerence between
the IF of IMF and the injected signal, the measurement error of fpeak may be much smaller than
the value of δ. By using fpeak − R1.8 relation given
by Eq.(10), the measurement accuracy of the IF is
transformed into the accuracy of R1.8 within a few
hundred meters.

SUMMARY

We performed the HHT analysis of GWs emitted from the late-inspiral, merger, and post-merger
phases of coalescence of BNSs. We used the waveforms computed by general relativistic numerical
simulations and the simulated time-series noise data
of Advanced LIGO. From the results of the HHT
analysis, we found that the frequency evolution can
be seen clearly on the time-frequency map, and that
the frequency evolution agrees with that of the injected signals. As pointed out in [9] and discussed in
Sec.III A, the frequency of GWs from MNS increases
with time for Hyp-EOS, while the frequency is overall unchanged for Shen-EOS. We confirmed that we
can distinguish the diﬀerence of the frequency evolution between Hyp-EOS models and Shen-EOS models in Sec.IV A and Sec. IV C. This fact suggest a
possibility that we may be able to distinguish the
EOS from the evolution of the IF of MNS by using
the HHT analysis.
We also investigated the statistical property of the
measurement accuracy of the IF for each of injected
signals. We found that for models in which MNS
signals last for 10 ms or more, the frequency modulation can be evaluated with error less than 5% for an
event at a distance of 10 Mpc. These results suggest
that we can evaluate the radius parameter R1.8 with
accuracy within a few hundred meters if a nearby

10
(lucky) event is detected by Advanced LIGO.
The peak frequency can also be evaluated by using
usual Fourier spectrum of data. In that sense, the
peak frequency derived from the HHT is just an additional evidence of the peak frequency. Note, however, that, as stated above, the information which
can be obtained by the HHT analysis is not limited
to the peak frequency. We can also clearly observe
the frequency evolution of the signals. This is one of
the most important advantage of the HHT analysis.
In this paper, we assumed that the sources are located at the distance of 5 or 10 Mpc The expected
detection rate at 10 Mpc is ∼ 10−4 - 0.1 events
yr−1 [4]. Thus, Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo
and KAGRA may not observe BNS coalescences at
such distance. On the other hand, in the case of
a planned future detector, such like Einstein Telescope [29], the detectable distance will be increased
by factor of ∼ 10. In that case, the expected event
rate becames ∼ 0.1 - 100 events yr−1 . Thus, we may
have to wait until such future detectors are realized
before the HHT analysis of MNS signals presented
in this paper become useful.
In this paper, we used simulated Gaussian noise
of Advanced LIGO. However, the noise of real laser

interferometer detectors show non-Gaussianity and
non-stationarity. Therefore, we are planning to apply our method to real laser interferometer data in
the near future.
