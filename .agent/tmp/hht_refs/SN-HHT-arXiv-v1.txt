Through numerical simulations, it is predicted that the gravitational waves (GWs) reflect the
characteristics of the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosion mechanism. There are multiple
GW excitation processes that occur inside a star before its explosion, and it is suggested that the
GWs originating from the CCSN have a mode for each excitation process in terms of time-frequency
representation. Therefore, we propose an application of the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT), which
is a high-resolution time-frequency analysis method, to analyze these GW modes for theoretically
probing and increasing our understanding of the explosion mechanism. The HHT defines frequency
as a function of time, and is not bound by the trade-off between time and frequency resolutions.
In this study, we analyze a gravitational waveform obtained from a three-dimensional generalrelativistic CCSN model that showed a vigorous activity of the standing-accretion-shock-instability
(SASI). We succeed in extracting the SASI induced GWs with high resolution on a time-frequency
representation using the HHT and we examine their instantaneous frequencies.

INTRODUCTION

Advanced LIGO [1] and Advanced Virgo [2] detected
11 gravitational wave (GW) events during the first and
the second observing run (O1 and O2) [3]. The third observing run (O3) started in April 2019 but was globally
suspended in March 2020. It has been reported that 39
candidate GW events were found in the data during the
first half of O3 [4]. GEO600 [5] and KAGRA [6, 7] conducted a joint two-week observing run (O3GK) in April
2020. The next fourth observing run (O4) will be a joint
observation of LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA.
The only type of event currently detected is a compact
binary coalescence (CBC), and new sources, such as the
core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), are expected to be detected by using the third-generation GW detectors (e.g.
Einstein Telescope [8], Cosmic Explorer [9] etc.) [10].
The GWs from CBC are generally analyzed by employing a matched filter (MF) that uses model waveforms.
However, a proper model waveform can hardly be created for the GWs from CCSNe (see [11, 12] for a review)
and therefore, it is in general difficult to apply the MF in
this case. These unmodeled GWs are usually analyzed
by some types of time-frequency representation (TFR)

techniques.
Since the GWs from CCSNe have characteristic modes
in TFR, spectrogram analysis has recently become the
mainstream method for detecting them and classifying
CCSNe models, rather than analyzing time-series waveforms [13–23]. In particular, the mainstream detection
method is TFR analysis of coherent multi-detector networks in the wavelet domain [13–15]. Principal component analysis has also been shown to be useful for detection and classification, and software for supernova classification has been developed [16–20]. Furthermore, machine learning has been shown to be useful for detection and classification, and these methods are already
capable of properly analyzing signals embedded in the
non-Gaussian and non-stationary noise of the GW detectors [21–23]. This paper proposes a new application
of TFR with the ultimate goal of analyzing the structure
of detected and classified GWs from the CCSNe in more
detail.
The importance of GWs in the CCSNe research is
demonstrated by the results of numerical simulations. It
has been hypothesized that the GWs carry information
about the star’s internal state before its explosion and
consists of the GWs from several emission mechanisms

2
that occurred in the star’s core. Although there are several multidimensional general relativistic hydrodynamics simulations to obtain, at least, a theoretical explanation of the mechanism of CCSNe, it is not yet fully
understood. The characteristics of the GW waveform
depends on the emission mechanism, and GWs could be
the “smoking gun” for the phenomena that take place inside the star. However, the theoretically predicted GW
amplitudes from CCSNe are extremely small and are usually hidden by the background noise [15]. Therefore,
together with the poorly understood CCSN explosion
mechanisms, it makes difficult to even detect the GW
signals in the expected real events, and even more to decipher their physical meanings to infer the phenomena
occurring inside the stellar core.
In the event of a gravitational collapse, the core temperature and density of the collapsed star increases
rapidly, thereby trapping the neutrinos. Following this,
when the density exceeds the nuclear saturation density,
the core rapidly regains pressure, which competes with
its self-gravity and causes core bounce. This leads to
the formation of the shock wave in the vicinity of the
inner core. At the core bounce, the unshocked core also
gives rise to the formation of a proto-neutron star (PNS),
the evolution of which depends on the explosion dynamics (e.g. mass accretion rate onto it) in the postbounce
phase. The bounce shock does not immediately blow-off
the outer layer of the collapsed core, but is temporarily
stalled (e.g. [24] for a review). Before the possible onset of
the neutrino-driven explosions, the stalled shock is known
to be susceptible to multi-dimensional fluid instabilities
(see [25–27] for recent reviews) including neutrino-driven
convection and the standing accretion shock instability
(SASI [28]), the latter of which globally deforms the
shock surface. The briskness of the SASI depends on
the nuclear equation of state (EoS) and initial conditions
for the simulation, such as progenitor compactness and
rotation. One of its remarkable features related to the
GW emission mechanism is that, once it is fully grown,
it produces a time modulated mass accretion onto the
PNS core. The time modulated mass accretion penetrates deep into the PNS and trigger a surface distortion
and motion of the central PNS core. From there and also
from the globally deformed regions behind the shock [29],
sizeable GWs could be emitted with their time frequency
being characterized by the SASI frequency of the order
of ∼ 100 Hz [29–36] (we call them as SASI mode here
after).
In this paper, we particularly focus on the GWs emitted from the SASI activities by discussing models developed by Kuroda et al. [30]. The models are based
on numerical-relativity simulations taking into account a
gray energy neutrino transport. In fact, the GW simulated by these previous studies has the SASI mode in
the time-frequency representation and its frequency band
(∼ 100 − 200 Hz) is significantly smaller than the PNS
surface g-mode oscillation (∼ 700 Hz) induced by convection. The details of the behavior of the PNS in the

simulation when the SASI occurs have been investigated
by Kawahara et al. [37] using GW analysis.
We further suggest that Hilbert-Huang Transform
(HHT) [38–41] can be used to investigate whether we
can actually capture the onset of the SASI, and if so, to
what extent we can capture the nature of the SASI.
HHT was first applied to the analysis of GWs in
2007 [42]. Here, we highlight two advantages of using
the HHT for analyzing the GWs. First, the HHT does
not have the time and frequency resolution trade-off because it defines frequency as a function of time. This is
called the instantaneous frequency (IF). Moreover, the
amplitude, phase, and frequency acquired by the HHT
have the same time resolution as the original time series
signal. Second, the HHT decomposes the original time
series signal into several time series signals that oscillate
around the zero point. This process should be able to
separate and obtain those modes from the GWs in which
multiple radiation processes are mixed. Hence, it is fit for
the analysis of GWs from the CCSNe. The effectiveness
of the HHT in the GW analysis has been shown by studies assuming binary black hole (BBH), binary neutron
star (BNS), and burst [43–47]. Furthermore, the HHT
also worked well for the analysis of GW150914, which is
the first GW detection event [48].
This paper proposes a method with HHT of analyzing
gravitational waves from a core collapse supernova. This
is important to decipher what could be the driving mechanism of supernova explosion from observed GWs in the
future. We have reanalyzed a GW analyzed by [30, 37]
with the HHT. In particular, we focused on how clearly
and accurately the SASI mode can be extracted and
showed the HHT is a promising tool for it. Detailed
analyses of results of various simulations will be given
elsewhere.
This paper is organized as follows: In section II, we
introduce overview of the HHT. In section III, we describe the dynamics of a 3D CCSN model of our interest and its GW emission mechanisms. In section IV, we
demonstrate the time-frequency representation using the
HHT. In section V, we propose our method of analyzing
the frequency and apply it to test signal and simulated
GWs. Finally, we summarize and discuss our results in
section VI.

II.

HILBERT-HUANG TRANSFORM

The HHT consists of two steps. The first step is the
empirical mode decomposition (EMD) that decomposes
the original signal into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs).
The second step is the Hilbert spectral analysis (HSA) of
each IMF [39].
The HSA is a type of TFRs using the Hilbert transform
(HT),

where u(t) is a real function of time, PV and ∗ denote
the Cauchy principal value of the singular integral and
convolution, respectively. Using the HT, the complex
signal F (t) can be defined from a real signal u(t) [49] as


F (t) = u(t) + iH[u(t)] = a(t) exp iφ(t) ,

(II.4)

Note that if u(t) is the real part on the real axis of a complex function F (z) that is analytic in the upper half complex plane and goes to zero rapidly enough for |z| → ∞,
the imaginary part of F (z) on the real axis is uniquely
given by the HT of u(t), provided the HT in Eq.(II.1)
exists. Here, a(t) and φ(t) can be considered as the instantaneous amplitude (IA) and the instantaneous phase
of the signal, respectively, if the characteristic time scale
of variation of a(t) is longer than that of φ(t). The instantaneous frequency (IF) is simply given by
f (t) =

1 dφ(t)
.
2π dt

(II.5)

The HSA gives IA and IF which have a clear physical
picture with a signal of a single oscillation mode. However, it is not the case with a signal including multiple
oscillation modes. Huang et al. [39] proposed that this
fault can be overcome if an actual observed signal s(t)
is decomposed into a finite number of IMFs cj (t) along
with a residual r(t) as
s(t) =

N
X

cj (t) + r(t),

(II.6)

j=1

by using the EMD. Here each IMF cj (t) oscillates around
zero and r(t) is a non-oscillation mode. The EMD is
a series of adaptive sifting processes that reveal highfrequency impacts without leaving the time domain. The
first IMF (IMF1), c1 (t), has the shortest characteristic
time scale, that is, it represents the highest frequency
mode of the original signal.
The HHT is very useful to analyze non-stationary
and nonlinear signals, but the simple EMD encounters
weighty problems in some cases. Wu and Huang [50] introduced the ensemble EMD (EEMD) to solve the modemixing problem.
The EEMD consists of the following steps:
1. Add a Gaussian white noise series to the original
signal.
2. Apply the EMD to the data with added white noise
to obtain IMFs.
3. Make ensembles of IMFs by repeating step 1 and
step 2 many times with different white noise series
added each time.

4. Take the ensemble mean of each ensemble to obtain
the final result of each IMF.
In these steps, the mode mixing is effectively eliminated,
while the added noise is averaged out through ensemble
average. There are two significant parameters that need
to be predetermined in these steps. The one is the amplitude of added noise. It depends on the characteristics of
the original signal but it is usually suggested that the ratio of the standard deviation of the Gaussian white noise
to that of the original signal, σeemd , is less than unity.
However, Hiranuma et al. [51] found that the larger value
is appropriate to effectively eliminate the mode mixing
with the signal that will be analyzed in this paper. The
other parameter is the number of ensemble trials Neemd ,
which mainly depends on the value of σeemd . Although
the value of Neemd is infinity to cancel out the effect of
the added withe noise completely, too large value would
increase computational cost. After some trials of these
parameters with our signal, we found that the most appropriate value of σeemd is 10. For this amplitude, a very
large value of Neemd is required. It was found that the
final results does not change with the number of trial
larger than 106 at most. Hence we set σeemd and Neemd
on 10 and 106 , respectively, in this paper unless otherwise indicated. We used KAGRA Algorithmic Library
(KAGALI) [52] for HHT calculation.

III.

3D CCSN MODEL

In this section, we describe the dynamics of a 3D CCSN
model of our interest and its GW emission mechanisms
before going to explaining the applicability of HHT analysis for simulated gravitational waveform. The initial
conditions are [30]: the progenitor mass is 15M , no
rotation, and the EoS is “SFHx”. This simulation was
calculated up to 0.35 s from the core bounce time, and its
GW was derived using the standard quadrupole formula,
assuming a distance of 10 kpc.
Shortly after core bounce, the initial post bounce convection develops due to the negative entropy gradient. It
emits GWs at a relatively low frequency range of ∼ 100
Hz and lasts till ∼ 100 ms after bounce. Afterward the
dominant hydrodynamic activity can be taken over by a
non-linear SASI motion, while the PNS convection still
coexists. Once the SASI phase initiates, the standing
shock surface globally deforms its morphology depending on the dominant SASI mode, which varies from moment to moment. For instance in the current 3D CCSN
model, the dominant mode is initially a sloshing mode,
which gradually shifts to a rotating spiral mode around
200 ms after bounce. In either mode, a typical frequency
of SASI appears at ∼ 100 Hz, which can be derived from
shock radii ∼ 100 km divided by the advection speed of
fluid in the shocked region ∼ 108 cm s−1 . At ∼ 300 ms
after bounce, the hydrodynamic activity is again dominated by the convective motion.

4
Based on the 3D CCSN model, [30] discussed a new
gravitational wave emission mechanism in association
with the vigorous SASI activities. They demonstrated
that the low-frequency GW emissions can be triggered
by a strong mass accretion having the same temporal dependence with the SASI frequency [see also 31, 32, 35].
In the next section, we will discuss how such a characteristic frequency, which usually varies with time, can be
extracted from the waveform using the HHT.
Here we should comment on the neutrino treatment
used in the current 3D CCSN model. It was calculated
by a gray energy neutrino transport that is no longer
state-of-the-art simulation compared to the recent spectral neutrino transport simulations. We, however, anticipate that the main focus of this study, i.e., extracting the
characteristic GW frequencies associated with the SASI,
would not be affected even if we use another model with
more sophisticated neutrino transport. This is because
that the development of SASI and its GW emission do
not sensitively depend on the neutrino transport method.
It can be justified from recent full-fledged 3D spectral
neutrino transport simulations such as [18, 31, 35], in
which they reported the SASI developments.

IV.

APPLICATION OF HHT FOR A
SIMULATED GW

We show the applicability of TFR using the HHT for
a GW signal from the aforementioned three-dimensional
general-relativistic (GR) core-collapsed supernova simulation [30]. Both upper panels in Fig. 1 show the same
GW signal (h× ) [30] and the lower panels show the timefrequency map calculated using short time Fourier transform (STFT) (Fig. 1(a)) and the HHT (Fig. 1(b)). There
are two strong signals in both the time-frequency domains: one is the PNS surface g-mode (gravity-mode),
whose frequency increases rapidly with time at about
0.05 − 0.35 s; the other has a lower frequency than the gmode and is suggested to be induced by the SASI mode.
Using the STFT calculations, we can estimate that the
SASI mode has a low frequency band and is approximately constant. We confirmed that there is no significant difference between results with h× and h+ , and
therefore we show only the results with h× here and hereinafter.
Hence, we compare our results with the previously reported outcomes [30, 37]. Apart from the two strong
modes (g-mode, SASI mode), there are several other
modes in TFR, also appear in the HHT. However, the
IAs, which denote the weight of the wave with the frequency exist, are small. Thus, we do not focus on these
modes and analyze only the SASI mode.
We decomposed the GW signal into the IMFs and
showed the IMF1-6 in Fig. 2(a). The g-mode and SASI
mode components were extracted as the IMF3 and IMF5,
respectively. Fig. 2(b) illustrates the IMF5, its IA and
IF, and indicates that the SASI mode did not appear

up to about ∼ 0.1 s from the core bounce time and it
perhaps oscillates with about ∼ 150 Hz after that.
Since the HHT has a higher time and frequency resolution than that of the STFT, the HHT is suitable for identifying the SASI dominant phase and investigating the
time-dependency of its GW frequency. Extracting the instantaneous characteristic GW frequency from detected
GWs particularly exerts its ability in multi-messenger astronomy. This is because the SASI activity may imprint
its time modulated signal in both the gravitational waveform [30, 31, 35] and also in the neutrino signal [53, 54].
We, therefore, need to determine more precisely the characteristic GW frequency to link the GW and neutrino
signal and to identify that they are emitted from the
same origin. For that purpose, we propose a method to
investigate the characteristics of a GW frequency from
the SASI based on the HHT.
In section V, we discuss how to analyze the SASI mode
properly and show our results.
V.

ANALYSIS OF THE INSTANTANEOUS
FREQUENCY

We show the method to analyze the IF of the IMF5,
which includes the SASI mode. The activity of the GWs
derived from SASI changes depending on the selection
of the mass of progenitors and EoS, and the theory that
describes their properties has not been confirmed [30, 54].
We propose a method for investigating the characteristics
of the GWs derived from SASI using the HHT. Here, we
analyze the IF to estimate the time when the SASI mode
occurred, and investigate the average and trend of the IF.
Furthermore, the systematic error discovered by applying
the same method to the test waveform imitating the GW
is described.
A.

Method and demonstration

We use a sine-Gaussian waveform with constant frequency as the test signal,

where gl is the white Gaussian noise, l is (l =
1, · · · , Ntest ), Ntest is number of the white Gaussian noise
signals generated from different seeds. In Eq. (V.1),
the former simulates the SASI mode, and latter simulates the numerical error. We used the parameters
tshift = 0.22, twidth = 0.4, fconst = 130 Hz and the corresponding signal is shown in Fig. 3(a). The reason for
using a sine-Gaussian wave is that, as shown in Fig. 1,
the SASI has a waveform in which the amplitude becomes
stronger from a certain time, the frequency is almost constant, and then disappears after vibration. The SASI is

GW signal wave (h× ) “SFHx” [30] and sampling frequency of the signal is 16 kHz. In bottom panels of (a) and (b), the
x-axis and y-axis represent the post core bounce time and frequency in logarithmic scale, respectively. STFT’s color bar denote
amplitude spectrum and HHT’s color bar denote instantaneous amplitude. In the STFT calculation, we used the Hanning
window function and adopted ∼ 0.048 s window width and ∼ 0.042 s overlap.

a phenomenon whose generation conditions and behavior are still under study, and there is no universal model
with a theoretical support to investigate SASI. However,
it is reasonable to assume that the frequency of SASI
is almost constant in SFHx, as reported by Kuroda et
al [30].

Figure 3 shows the results of HHT of the test signal. In
this analysis, a low trial number, namely, Neemd = 103 is
applied since the results do not change even with higher
values of Neemd for a simple signal like Eq.(V.1). Figure 3(b) shows that sine-Gaussian wave was compared to
the IMF5, and the fact that the amplitude of the IMF5 is
smaller than the sine-Gaussian wave in Fig. 3(c) indicates
that mode splitting has occurred. Probably the IMF1-3,
6 are mostly noise components. The components of the
sine-Gaussian wave split in the IMF4. From Fig. 3(c),
the IF does not have a physical meaning owing to the
influence of noise and calculation error where the amplitude is small, and the frequency vibrates around 130 Hz
owing to the influence of the white Gaussian noise, even
where the amplitude is large. It is assumed that there
are many cases where the mode splitting cannot be completely avoided in the actual analysis. In such cases, the
analysis is advanced using these results.

(A) Estimating the starting point of the target mode

We estimated the appearance time tstart and disappearance time tend of the signal on the IMF. For this, we
referred to [48], which used the root mean squared error
(RMSE) and assumed a constant IF.
The appearance and disappearance times were defined
using discrete time series signals as:
tstart (n0 ) = n0 ∆t,
tend (n0 , NT ) = tstart + T
= (n0 + NT )∆t,

(V.2)
(V.3)

where, n0 is a segment of tstart , ∆t is the sampling
time interval, that is, inverse of the sampling frequency
(∆t = 1/fsampling ), T is time of appearance of the signal,
and NT is the number of segments of T . The segment
[n0 , n0 + NT ] is estimated using n0 and NT as variables.
The first step is to estimate the optimal tstart for each
NT . We calculate the IF variances σ̂(n0 , NT ) of the segment [n0 , n0 + NT ] in all possible n0 for a fixed NT .

The second step is to determine the optical NT . We

• The SASI mode appear in parts of the IMF.
On the NT −σ map, σ gradually increases NT in the time

zero, and this method is expected to function properly
in the time segment where the SASI mode dominates as
shown in Fig. 4.

The fitting result is shown in Fig. 5 and the coefficients are listed in Table I. These results indicate that
the test signal with a constant frequency at 130 Hz can
be analyzed properly. Additionally, when the weighting
function is not used (wi = 1), the average IF deviates
from its original value; therefore, the weighting function
is necessary to obtain an appropriate result.

To estimate the error caused by the above method,
we prepared Ntest = 1000 test signals and generated a
histogram of the estimated values.
Figure 6 shows the histograms of the fitting coefficients, the average frequency, and the time interval. The
top two histograms in the rightmost column are the results for the time interval. The top histogram in the the
second column from the right is the result of the average
frequency. The rest are histograms of the fitting coefficients. The widths of the histograms reflect variations in
the results for Ntest = 1000 test signals. These are due
to the fact that mode decomposition in EEMD could not
be performed perfectly, and the noise behavior in which
only the seed of Eq. (V.1) in the second term appears
different. When applying this method to the GWs, the
above should be considered a systematic error.

Analysis of the simulated GW from CCSNe

We apply the above method to a simulated GW from
a CCSN model of [30] in Fig. 2(b). First, we estimated
the time segment at which the SASI would appear. Next,
we searched for the optimal segment [0.0 s, 0.35 s] to get
NTbest . Using this, we further searched for [0.0 s, NTbest ]
and [NTbest , 0.35 s] to obtain the second and third NTbest ,
respectively. We selected an NTbest based on the smallest IF fitting error. The results are shown in Fig. 7.
We estimated that the SASI mode was dominant at

was ready ∼ 0.1 s after the core bounce (t = 0 s). The
end time (∼ 0.35 s) is close to the time when the simulation ceased calculating, and it is speculated that the
SASI may have temporarily weakened. The fitting result is shown in Fig. 8 and the coefficients are listed in
Table II. Fig. 9 shows the results of the GW analysis together with Fig. 6, where the fitting coefficients are the
red dashed lines and the error of the coefficients is the
white range. The average frequency of the GW is shown
in the error range around the 0 axis and is not shown a
red dashed line. The time interval of the GW is shown
as a red dashed line and is not shown in the error range.
The values of b2 and c2 suggest that the frequency of
SASI may fluctuate. However, considering the error generated in the test signal, this analysis method uses the
GW obtained from the SASI mode in the segment. No
time change was obtained from the IF.

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

We analyzed a simulated GW signal from a corecollapse supernova (CCSN), which contained the strong
SASI mode, using the HHT technique. The frequency of
the SASI has information on the internal dynamics of the
star before the explosion; therefore, we examined the behavior of the SASI frequency of the simulated signal. The
HHT method could isolate the IF of each physical mode
that was generated in the signal source. Consequently, we
endeavored to evaluate the feasibility of employing HHT
to analyze GWs generated by the SASI mode. Thus, we
performed a statistical analysis because the IF was defined as a function of time, and found that the IF of the
SASI mode extracted in the IMF5 was constant, namely
hf i = 127.0 ± 3.7 Hz, with time within 1σ in the time
segment 0.116 s . t . 0.347 s.

vanced Virgo, and KAGRA) if the event is in the Galaxy.
Therefore, there is a high possibility that SASI mode
can be detected with Einstein Telescope [8], Cosmic Explorer [9], and thus, we plan to study the practical applications of HHT in the near future.

Our results were consistent with the previously reported research outcomes [30, 37] and established the effectiveness of the HHT technique. Hence, we can expect
the HHT to work well for analyzing the SASI mode from
the observation signals, and it will be important to search
for the signal that is superimposed on the simulated GW
signals and GW detector noises.
