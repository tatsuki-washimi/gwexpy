Abstract. We propose a new detection method for gravitational wave bursts. It
analyzes observed data with the Hilbert-Huang transform, which is an approach of
time-frequency analysis constructed with the aim of manipulating non-linear and
non-stationary data. Using the simulated time-series noise data and waveforms
from rotating core-collapse supernovae at 30 kpc, we performed simulation to
evaluate the performance of our method and it revealed the total detection
probability to be 0.94 without false alerms, which corresponds to the false alarm
rate < 10−3 Hz. The detection probability depends on the characteristics of
the waveform, but it was found that the parameter determining the degree
of diﬀerential rotation of the collapsing star is the most important for the
performance of our method.

1. Introduction
The full operations of the advanced ground-based laser interferometer detectors for
gravitational waves, such as Advanced LIGO [1] in the USA, Advanced Virgo [2] in
Italy and KAGRA [3] in Japan, are about to be implemented. Their main targets
are gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences, because waveforms of them
are predictable with high accuracy in the post-Newtonian approximation of general
relativity [4]. In other words, gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences
can be detected by means of matched filtering analysis.

Gravitational wave bursts from various sources, such as gamma-ray bursts, corecollapse supernovae, soft-gamma repeaters, cosmic strings, late inspiral and mergers
of compact binaries, ring-downs of perturbed neutron stars or black holes, are also
thought as detectable by these detectors as well. However, it is not easy to predict
waveforms from these sources with suﬃcient high accuracy for matched filtering,
because their dynamics are complicated and the equation of state of neutron star
matter is not known so well. Thus, a detection method that does not require exact
information of waveforms is needed for the detection of gravitational wave bursts.
Anderson et al. [5] have given a solution to it, namely, the Excess Power Method.
It analyzes an observed data in time-frequency space by means of the short time
Fourier transform. It requires only knowledge of the duration and frequency band
of target signals. Thus, the Excess Power Method is well accepted in the field of
gravitational wave data analysis. Recently, several new approaches for the detection
of gravitational wave bursts with no or a little assumptions on the source models have
been developed [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11].
In fact, it is by burst search pipeline that the gravitational wave signal
GW150914 was first identified [12, 13]. This event was announced by distinct search
pipelines, coherent waveburst algorithm [6], omicron-LALInference-Bursts [9], and
BayesWave [11]. As shown there, in order to enhance credibility of a detected event,
it is important to set up multiple pipelines designed to detect gravitational wave
bursts.
In this paper, we propose a new approach for amplitude-based detection method
of gravitational wave bursts by using Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT). In 1998, Huang
et al.[14] proposed the HHT as a new approach of time-frequency analysis. Its
characteristic feature is that it adaptively determines basis for decomposing according
to the input data. The adaptiveness provides two specific merits. One is that it is
capable of manipulating non-linear and non-stationary data, and the other is that
it is not restricted by the uncertain principle. Since gravitational wave signals are
mostly non-stationary and non-linear, the HHT is likely to be a powerful tool for
analyzing gravitational wave signals. So far, it has been applied to some data analysis
for gravitational waves [15, 16, 17, 18].
The HHT consists of two steps. One is the empirical mode decomposition (EMD)
and the other is Hilbert spectral analysis (HSA). The EMD decomposes time-series
data into finite numbers of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), each of which represents
simple intrinsic oscillation contained in the original data. The Hilbert transform is then
performed on each IMF to obtain instantaneous amplitude (IA) and instantaneous
frequency (IF). Consequently, we can extract time-evolutionary information of the
data with respect to the amplitude and frequency. The EMD works as waveletlike filter bank [19], and then noise will be dispersed into all IMFs with nearly
equal amplitude. A burst signal of gravitational waves, on the other hand, will be
decomposed into a single or a few set of IMFs, if it has a single oscillation mode. The
IA of the burst signal is thus significantly large only at specific regions in some IMFs.
Our method searches for the excess of the amplitude at these regions to know whether
the data contains gravitational waves.
To evaluate the performance of our method, we conduct a Monte Carlo simulation.
An ensemble of input data is made by adding a colored Gaussian noise based on
Advanced LIGO sensitivity curve [21] to a model signal of gravitational waves from a
rotating core-collapse supernova as well as a sine-Gaussian signal.
Throughout this paper, discrete sequences are represented with brackets, such as

This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we briefly describe simulated
time-series data of detector and the waveforms that we employ in this paper. In
section 3, we explain the our proposed amplitude-based detection method with HHT.
In section 4 and section 5, the results of the analysis with our proposed method
are shown and the implication of the results is discussed. Section 6 is devoted to a
summary.
2. Data set
We use a sensitivity curve of Advanced LIGO, namely, the zero-detuned, high-power
sensitivity curve [21], and produce 1000 realizations of Gaussian noise in frequency
domain. Each of time-series noise data, n(t), is produced by applying the inverse
Fourier transform to the corresponding realization. The sampling frequency is 4096
Hz and the duration of each segment of the time series is 0.5 s. We set cut-oﬀ frequency
at 10 Hz. Figure 1 shows the sensitivity curve and an example of simulated noise strain
in the upper panel, as well as the corresponding time-series n(t) in the lower panel.
Concerning the injected signals, we first consider sine-Gaussian signals as
simple models of short-duration gravitational-wave transients. As shown later, the
gravitational wave signal from a core-collapse supernova is mostly characterized by
a peak at the time of the core bounce and it can be emulated by a sine-Gaussian

Amplitude-based detection method for GW bursts with HHT

signal. Since the sine-Gaussian signal is narrowband, we can test the performance of
detection methods in those frequency bands. The sine-Gaussian signal that we used
is expressed as

where f , Q and α are constants. The amplitude α will be determined such that hrss

Next, as more realistic models, we use waveforms from rotating core-collapse
supernovae given by Dimmelmeier et al. [20].
In the simulation by Dimmelmeier et al., they used two nonzero-temperature
equations of state (EoS), to simulate some thermofluid dynamic quantities. One is
by Shen et al. [22] (Shen EoS), the other is by Lattimer and Swesty [23] (LS EoS).
LS EoS is based on a compressible liquid-drop model, and Shen EoS is based on a
relativistic mean field model. As presupernova stellar models, they employed various
nonrotating models with zero-age main sequence mass Mprog = 11.2M⊙ , 15.0M⊙ ,
20M⊙ and 40M⊙ (core-models s11, s15, s20 and s40, respectively), and some rotating
models with Mprog = 15.0M⊙ (core-models e15a and e15b) and 20.0M⊙ (core-models
e20a and e20b). They set those cores that are initially nonrotating (core-models s11,
s15, s20, and s40) artificially into rotation, whose specific angular momentum j is
given by
j = A2 (Ωc,i − Ω ).

(3)

Here A is the length that parameterizes the degree of diﬀerential rotation, Ω is the
angular velocity, and Ωc,i is the precollapse value of Ω at the center. The diﬀerentiality
becomes stronger as A is decreasing. In the Newtonian limit, this reduces to
A2
,
(4)
A2 + r2 sin2 θ
where r sin θ is the distance to the rotating axis. The precollapse rotation is
parameterized by in terms of A and Ωc,i , where A = 50 000 km indicates an almost
uniform rotation, A = 1000 km indicates a moderately diﬀerential rotation, and
A = 500 km indicates a strongly diﬀerential rotation.
In [20], the core collapse models are labeled according to Mprog , A and Ωc,i . We
sort them alphabetically by the original labels and assign waveform numbers to them,
that is, the waveforms in this paper are sorted by the values of Mprog , A, Ωc,i , and
then the EoS. As examples, the waveforms of 55, 78 and 133 are plotted in figure 2
and their parameters are listed in table 1.
Ω = Ωc,i

3. Detection Method
Our proposed method consists of a preprocessing part and an event trigger part. In
the preprocessing part, the HHT is performed to whitened observed data. In the
event trigger part, an event is triggered if an index value defined with respect to the
amplitude of the preprocessed data exceeds a predetermined threshold. We call this
method the Excess Amplitude Method (henceforth EAM).

The whitening process of observed data is conducted by using a linear predictive
error filter (LPEF). The LPEF is one of finite impulse response filters that flatten the
spectrum of data [24]. Cuoco et al. [25] have examined the availability of the LPEF
as a whitening method for signals from gravitational wave detectors, and it also has
been incorporated in some gravitational wave search methods [26, 27]. Refer to the
review by Chatterji et al. [27] for details.
Figure 3 shows the result of the LPEF applying to the simulated noise data of
Advanced LIGO (figure 1). We tuned the filter by using 1000 patterns of simulated
noise data.
The HHT is a method of time-frequency analysis for time-series data, developed
by Huang et al. [14]. The HHT consists of two steps, the empirical mode decomposition
(EMD) and the Hilbert spectral analysis (HSA). The HSA is based on the analytic
representation of a signal s(t) [28] such as
z(t) = s(t) + iH[s(t)]
= a(t) exp (iθ(t)) ,
where H[s(t)] is the Hilbert transform of s(t) defined by

Unfortunately, however, the HSA will not lead physically meaningful results unless
the signal s(t) is “monocomponent” and “narrowband” [14, 28]. The basic role of the
EMD is to decompose time-series data into finite numbers of IMFs, each of which
represents a simple intrinsic oscillation mode. The IMF has two specific properties,
namely, the numbers of its extrema and zero-crossing are the same or diﬀer by one,
and its local mean is zero at any point. Owing to these properties, the IMF admits
a well-behaved Hilbert transform. The original signal s(t) is sum of IMFs ci (t) and
residual r(t) of the EMD,
f (t) =

s(t) =

where NIMF is the number of IMFs.
Performing the Hilbert transform on the IMFs, the HHT tells multiple IAs and
IFs if the signal s(t) contains multiple oscillations and/or a broadband noise.
Because the HHT is not based on the assumption that the signal is stationary
or linear, it has a potential to analyze non-stationary and non-linear data. Detailed
descriptions of HHT algorithm used in this paper are found in [17, 18].

Since EMD works as wavelet-like filter bank [19], whitened noise whose spectrum
distributes uniformly will be dispersed into almost all IMFs with nearly equal
amplitude. A gravitational wave burst signal, on the other hand, will be mostly
decomposed into a small number of IMFs, and hence the IAs of these IMFs become
significantly large in some region. We can therefore expect that gravitational-wave
bursts will be detected by finding the region where IA exceeds a certain threshold.
As the first step of the event trigger part, we need to study the statistical
characteristics of IA for the background, that is, the average µi and the standard
deviation σi of IAi for IMFi (i = 1, 2, . . . , NIMF ). In the present simulation, µi and σi
are estimated from over 1000 realizations of whitened noise-only data. We then define
the conditional averaging function Ak (ai [n]|µi , σi ) and the maximum mean amplitude
xk , respectively, by

where Ld is the data length. The definition (10) means that the input data is judged
to contain no signal in the region if the IA is less than µ + 4σ of the noise level.
The EAM will trigger an event of a gravitational wave, if the index value xk
is greater than or equal to a predetermined threshold value xTH . We will discuss
appropriate values of the window size k and the threshold xTH in the next section.
4. Simulation
To estimate the optimal window size k and the optimal threshold xTH , we have
conducted simulations of applying the EAM to simulated data. The data were
superpositions of simulated gravitational wave burst signals (sine-Gaussian and corecollapse supernova signal) and each of 1000 realizations of simulated Advanced LIGO
noise data. In this paper, we assumed that gravitational wave bursts had entered with
optimal orientation of the detector and the event of emitting gravitational wave had
occurred in our galaxy (at most 30 kpc apart from the earth). In this case, average
hrss of the simulated signals is 9.578 × 10−21 .
To estimate false alerm rate (FAR), we also applied the EAM to each realization
of simulated noise data without signal injection.
First, we used the sine-Gaussian signals defined in (1). We considered the four
cases: (f = 235 Hz, Q = 5), (f = 235 Hz, Q = 15), (f = 820 Hz, Q = 5) and
(f = 820 Hz, Q = 15). We provisionally let the window size k be 41; this value means
the duration of window is about 10 ms. Figure 4 shows the variations in detection
probability of sine-Gaussian signals in accordance with threshold value xTH . It reveals
that the EAM will detect almost all events, namely the detection probability being at
least 0.999, without false alerms when the threshold value is between 2.8 × 10−22 to
7.2 × 10−22 .

Second, we used the simulated waveforms of core-collapse supernovae. Figure 5
shows the variations in detection probability of them with threshold value. Detection
probabilities vary with waveform, which corresponds to the EoS and the parameters
of initial configurations of core-collapse models. For more than half waveforms, some
values of threshold will give the detection probability of 1.0 without false alerms,
while the detection probability never reaches 1.0 with any threshold value for some
waveforms.
To evaluate the performance of the EAM more comprehensively, we plotted
a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which is created by plotting the
detection probability of a target signal against the FAR. Figure 6 shows the ROC

curve of the EAM for all waveforms of core-collapse we used. It reveals that the EAM
has the detection probability of at least 0.85, with the false alarm rate < 10−3 Hz. It
also indicates the whitening process plays an important role to improve the eﬃciency
in the EAM.
We plotted the ROC curves of the EAM for various values of k in figure 7. A
small window size is expected to give a high detection probability, since it can detect
even short-term excess of the amplitude. However it is likely to lead a high FAR at
the same time. Therefore, we have to look for the optimal value of the window size
to the maximum of the detection probability with the minimum of the FAR. The left
panel of figure 7 shows a comparison of the window size k ranging from 20 to 60, and
it indicates that the optimal value of k lies between 40 and 45. A minute comparison
in this range is made in the right panel of figure 7 and it suggests that the optimal
value of k is 41.
We also checked the optimal window size for each waveform. If the detection
probability of some waveforms becomes the highest value with two or more window
sizes, the optimal window size of the waveform is chosen the one of them with which
the total detection probability becomes highest. The optimal window size of each
waveform is shown in figure 8. The optimal value is 15, 22, 41 or 64 for all the
waveforms with few exceptions. The exceptions are k = 44 for five waveforms, k = 20
for one waveform, and k = 50 for one waveform.
Consequently, we will perform the EAM analysis with these four values of k
simultaneously. Triggers are recorded if xk exceeds the threshold for at least one of k.
The ROC curve of the EAM with some window size is shown in figure 9. It reveals that
the detection eﬃciency is improved significantly. Eventually, the detection eﬃciency
(the detection probability without false alerms in our realizations, which corresponds
to the false alarm rate < 10−3 Hz in our simulation) of our proposed method reached
0.940.
As mentioned before with figure 5, the threshold value that leads high detection
probability depends on waveforms of its target signal. The detection probability can

be 1.0 without false alerms for some waveforms (hereinafter referred to as class C1)
if an appropriate threshold value xTH depending on the waveforms is adopted, while
it cannot be realized with any threshold values for other waveforms (class C2). In
figure 10, we plotted hrss for each waveform as well as the threshold values above
which the detection probability becomes 1.0. It shows that there is a strong correlation
between them, yielding the correlation coeﬃcient of 0.893. These waveforms of class
C1 have hrss of 1.0 × 10−20 or above, while only 4 of 66 waveforms of class C2 have
hrss of this value. The parameters of core-collapse simulations of class C1 are listed
in table 2. It indicates that the parameter A of class C1 is 1000 km or below, while
waveforms of A = 50 000km, which corresponds to almost uniform rotation, belong
to class C2. As a result, the degree of diﬀerential rotation is more important for the
EAM than the mass of the star.
As examples, five waveforms for each of A = 50 000, 1000, and 500 km are
plotted in figure 4. It indicates that the amplitude of the gravitational wave from
the supernova is high if diﬀerential rotation of the initial configuration is strong, or A
is small. It is one of reasons why the eﬃciency of the EAM largely depends on A.
5. Discussion
The optimal window size depends on the waveform as figure 8 shows and thus the
eﬃciency of the EAM can be improved if the multi-window-size EAM is applied
as figure 9 shows. In order to apply the EAM for detecting a specific target, it is
important to investigate why the optimal window size depends on the waveform. In
each panel of figure 12, we plotted four of waveforms that have the same value of the
optimal window size, namely, k = 15 (type k15), k = 22 (k22), k = 41 (k41), and
k = 64 (k64), and the ROC curves of these types are shown in figure 13. Table 3
shows the breakdown by the value of A of each type.
The waves of types k22 and k41 have similar shapes, that is, one sharp peak
with little transient followed by a short ringdown. The optimal window size of k41

is, however, larger than that of k22, since the peak and the beginning part of the
ringdown of k41 are decomposed into the single IMF by the EMD, while those of k22
are decomposed into diﬀerent IMFs. The waves of k15 have a short peak but the
amplitude is low, and hence the optimal window size will be small to compensate for
the low amplitude with a contribution from the short peak maximally. Since the waves
of k64 have no significant peak and the amplitude is low, the detection probability is
much lower than other types as figure 13 shows. As shown in table 3, the parameter
A of all the member of this type except few exceptions is 50 000 km, that is, they
are almost uniformly rotating at the initial time. It means that uniform rotation

causes the low amplitude and thus leads to the diﬃculty in detecting waves. The
large window size is required for averaging out the noise to reduce false alerms, rather
than enhancing the eﬃciency.
Since only amplitude variations of the IMFs are considered at present, it is diﬃcult
to detect signals whose amplitude is low throughout even though the duration is long.
6. Summary
We validated a possibility of a new amplitude-based approach for the detection of
gravitational wave bursts with the Hilbert-Huang transform. Our proposed method,
called Excess Amplitude Method, will detect an event when the maximum value of all
the maximum value in each intrinsic mode function of an observed data is greater
than a predetermined threshold value. Using the simulated time-series noise data
and waveforms from rotating core-collapse supernovae at 30 kpc, we performed the
simulation to evaluate the performance of our proposed method and found that the
detection probability reaches 0.94 without false alerms, which corresponds to the false

At the present, we do not take variations of the instantaneous frequency of the
IMFs into account, but it must provide the useful information to distinguish signals
from noise. We will include the information of the instantaneous frequency in the next
version of our method.
We used simulated Gaussian noise of Advanced LIGO in this paper, but the noise
of real laser interferometer detectors show non-Gaussianity and non-stationarity. We
will apply our method to real laser interferometer data and compare the results with

other detection methods such as the excess power method soon. In addition, we are
planning to consider the coincidence analysis based on our method.
