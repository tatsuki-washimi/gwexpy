Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are potential multimessenger events detectable by current and
future gravitational wave (GW) detectors. The GW signals emitted during these events are expected
to provide insights into the explosion mechanism and the internal structures of neutron stars. In
recent years, several studies have empirically derived the relationship between the frequencies of
the GW signals originating from the oscillations of protoneutron stars (PNSs) and the physical
parameters of these stars. This study applies the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) [1] to extract
the frequencies of these modes to infer the physical properties of the PNSs. The results exhibit
comparable accuracy to a short-time Fourier transform-based estimation, highlighting the potential
of this approach as a complementary method for extracting physical information from GW signals
of CCSNe.
I.

INTRODUCTION

Advanced gravitational-wave (GW) detectors now regularly observe signals from compact binary coalescences,
with over 90 detections recorded to date [2–5]. The anticipated next milestone for these detectors is the first
observation of the GW signal from a core-collapse supernova (CCSN). A CCSN is an explosion of a massive
star, which leads to the formation of either a neutron
star or a stellar-mass black hole. This explosion usually
emits electromagnetic waves, neutrinos, and GWs. Although the exact explosion mechanism remains unclear,
it is widely believed that most stars undergo neutrinodriven explosions [6, 7]. Current GW detectors, like Advanced LIGO [8], Advanced Virgo [9], and KAGRA [10],
are predicted to detect neutrino-driven CCSN explosions
occurring within our Galaxy, reaching a distance of ∼ 10
kpc [11]. Next-generation ground-based GW detectors,
such as the Cosmic Explorer [12, 13] and the Einstein
Telescope (ET) [14], are anticipated to enable the detection of these events from other galaxies, such as the Large
Magellanic Cloud. The kHz-band detector NEMO [15]
has also been proposed in Australia for studying nuclear
physics by observing high-frequency GWs. The detection of GW signals and their neutrino counterparts from
supernovae yields valuable insights into the inner core

of stars, offering crucial information about the explosion
mechanism.
Modeling the collapse of the stellar core, the bounce,
and the subsequent post-bounce evolution is extraordinarily complicated and computationally expensive. However, remarkable progress has been made in multidimensional numerical simulations of CCSN explosions over the
last decade. The characteristics of the GW waveform depend on the properties of its progenitor, such as mass, angular velocity, and equation of state, as well as on how the
simulations approximate general relativistic effects and
treat neutrino transport. Recent developments in these
computations have revealed common characteristics of
the CCSN signals. While the current standard burst GW
search pipeline, the coherent WaveBurst (cWB) [16–18],
does not rely on specific waveform morphologies, studies
have begun to utilize known features of GW waveforms
in detection algorithms. In particular, the application
of machine learning in detection algorithms [19–24] has
been studied extensively. Machine learning has also been
employed to classify equations of state or explosion mechanisms using simulated gravitational waveforms [25–28].
The GW spectrogram of CCSN explosions highlights
a noticeable time evolution of the frequency, increasing
monotonically over time. This so-called gravity-mode,
also known as g-mode, is believed to be associated with
the oscillation of PNSs [29, 30]. Characterizing these

2
modes is essential to enable CCSN asteroseismology using GWs (e.g. [31]). In recent years, numerical simulations have investigated the relationship between the frequency of these modes and the mass and radius of PNSs.
In their studies [32, 33], Torres-Forné et al., calculated
the relations between each f /g/p-mode and the physical parameters of the PNS. These relations are considered universal, as they are independent of the equation
of state or the progenitor mass. Sotani et al. [34] suggest that once we observe a GW signal from a CCSN
explosion, we can infer the physical parameters of the
PNS by extracting the frequencies of these modes and
solving the universal relations. In pursuing this goal,
Bizouard et al. [35] developed a method to track the gmode in a spectrogram to estimate the PNS properties
with current or next-generation GW detectors. Powell
and Müller [36] proposed a reconstruction approach in
the spectrogram domain with Bayesian inference and an
asymmetric chirplet model to extract the PNS properties. Bruel et al. [37] extended the study in Ref. [35]
by combining the data of a multi-detector network and
tracking the g-mode with a LASSO regression algorithm.
Moreover, Casallas-Lagos et al. [38] used a neural network regression model to estimate the slope of the highfrequency mode in a CCSN.
Accurate extraction of GW frequencies is essential
for inferring the physical properties of GW sources.
Unlike the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and
wavelet transforms, time-frequency maps produced by
the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) [1] are not constrained by the tradeoff between temporal duration and
bandwidth—this absence of limitation results in high resolutions along both the time and frequency axes.
In this context, the HHT has been explored within the
GW research domain, as documented by Camp et al. [39],
who recorded the first application of the HHT in GW
analysis. Numerous studies have highlighted the HHT’s
efficacy in identifying the frequencies of GW signals in
addition to its use in detection algorithms. This includes post-merger studies of binary neutron star coalescence [40, 41], binary black hole coalescence [42], and
low-frequency modes induced by neutrino-driven convection and standing accretion shock instability (SASI) in a
CCSN [43].
In this study, we propose an HHT-based approach
2
for estimating MPNS /RPNS
from the g-mode GW signal,
where MPNS and RPNS denote the mass and radius of
the PNS, respectively. Our method integrates the cWB
technique [16–18] and the extraction of the g-mode frequencies using the HHT to solve the universal relations
from Refs. [32, 33]. We first apply the method to the GW
signal-only case, then test it on signals in the ET’s simulated detector noise, and perform a comparative evaluation of the estimation accuracy with an approach based
on STFT.
This paper is organized as follows. Section II outlines
the data used to evaluate our methodology. Section III
details our approach for parameter estimation of PNSs.

The results are presented in Sec. IV. Finally, we conclude
our study in Sec. V.

II.

SIMULATION DATA

Our analysis uses two simulated GW signals generated
from different models to validate our parameter estimation method under two distinct conditions. The following
will describe the two GW signals, the ET detector, and
the preprocessing method.

A.

Signal waveform

This work uses the GW signals from the ‘he3.5’ [44]
and ‘y20’ [45] models. Both waveforms derive from
three-dimensional numerical simulations conducted with
the general-relativistic neutrino hydrodynamics code
CoCoNuT-FMT [46].
• The ‘he3.5’ progenitor model is an ultra-stripped star
evolved from a helium star with an initial mass of
3.5 M⊙ . The simulation is stopped at 0.7 s after the
supernova core bounce. The GW amplitude reaches its
highest at a peak frequency of around 900 Hz.
• The ‘y20’ progenitor model is a non-rotating, solar
metallicity helium star with a mass of 20 M⊙ . It has a
significantly higher mass than the first model, the simulation ends at 1.2 s after core bounce, and the GW
amplitude is the strongest at ∼ 600 Hz.
In this simulation, the GW signal comprises two polarization states: h+ (t) (plus) and h× (t) (cross) modes.
These modes are shown for each model in Fig. 1, where
the signals are observed from the equatorial plane at a
source distance of 10 kpc. Each model exhibits specific
features in their signal originating from PNS oscillations.
The strain signal h(t) of a GW signal is given, taking
into account the antenna pattern functions F+ and F× :
h(t) = F+ (α, δ, ψ, t)h+ (t) + F× (α, δ, ψ, t)h× (t),

(1)

where α is the right ascension, δ is the declination, and
ψ is the polarization angle.

B.

Einstein Telescope

The Einstein Telescope (ET) [14] is a third-generation
ground-based GW detector proposed to be constructed
underground in Europe. Its optical layout has yet to be
finalized, and various designs have been proposed [47].
The reference configuration is based on an equilateral
triangle of three detectors, each consisting of two interferometers with 10-km long arms. One of the two interferometers is specialized for low-frequency bands with
low laser power and cryogenic mirrors, while the other

Data Preprocessing

For the remainder of this analysis, the observer direction will be fixed in the equatorial plane at all times, and
the sky location will be at the ET detector’s optimal orientation. We sample GW signals and detector noises at a
sampling rate of 4096 Hz and apply a 100-1200 Hz bandpass filter. Additionally, we apply a notch filter around
420 Hz to eliminate noise, which appears as a sensitivity
peak in Fig. 2. The time origin is set to the moment
when the GW amplitude is maximum. Moreover, parts
of these computations were carried out using the PyCBC
software [51].

PARAMETER ESTIMATION

The parameter estimation aims to extract the g-mode
frequencies and solve the universal relations. The following subsections provide detailed descriptions of this
procedure.

Signal reconstruction

Both experimental data and noise-added simulated
data undergo the same reconstruction algorithm to extract GW transients. For this purpose, we employ the
cWB algorithm [16–18], an excess-power algorithm designed to detect and reconstruct GWs with minimal assumptions on waveform morphologies. This reconstruction step is applied to the raw data, illustrated by the
spectrogram Fig.3, to separate GW signal from detector
noise. In this figure, ‘he3.5’ model waveform is generated from a source distance of 17 kpc. Following this,
the HHT procedure to extract g-mode information from
CCSNe data.
We used PycWB [52], a modularized Python package
for the cWB reconstruction. We adopted the internal parameters and thresholds from the LIGO-Virgo targeted

is specialized for high-frequency bands with high laser
power and mirrors at room temperature.
Figure 2 shows the ‘ET-D’ sensitivity curve [48] along
with the frequency spectrum of the characteristic strain
of the ‘he3.5’ and ‘y20’ waveforms for an observer in the
equatorial plane from a distance of 10 kpc.
The characteristic strain hc (t), is a helpful metric for
comparing detector sensitivities with GW signals’ detectability [11]. Therefore, we use the ‘ET-D’ sensitivity
curve [49], current data analysis standard, to simulate the
ET detector noise. Unlike the strain signal h(t) of a GW
signal, the characteristic strain provides a way to visualize the potential signal strength relative to the detector’s
sensitivity [50]. Since the original ‘ET-D’ sensitivity is
computed for an L-shaped interferometer, we normalized
by sin(60◦ ) to make it for a triangular interferometer.

search for CCSNe during the O1 and O2 runs [53]. The
procedure for cWB reconstruction involves the multiple
steps. First, time-series data is whitened and turned into
a time-frequency domain using the Wilson-DaubechiesMeyer wavelet transform [54] for several different timefrequency resolutions. Pixel energy is maximized over all
sky locations, and pixels exceeding a specified threshold
are retained for each time-frequency map. Subsequently,
neighboring pixels are clustered as coincident pixels in
the multi-resolution time-frequency maps, and coherent
clusters across multiple detectors serve as triggers. Each
trigger undergoes evaluation using the constrained maximum likelihood method [16]. For accepted events, waveforms are reconstructed by applying the inverse wavelet
transform to the selected pixels.
Eventually, selected pixels by the cWB algorithm are
shown in Fig. 4. From such likelihood distribution, we
obtain the reconstructed signal from the ET1 detector as
shown in Fig. 5. Same reconstruction procedure applies
to the ‘y20’ model and shown similar results.
For signals injected into detector noise, we can measure
how well the reconstructed waveforms match the original
waveform by making use of the network match [55]. Let
wk represent the reconstructed waveform and hk be the

Hilbert-Huang transform

The HHT [1] comprises two steps: empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and Hilbert spectral analysis. In
the first step, EMD decomposes a time-series signal into
a sum of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) denoted ck (t),
where k represents the k-th IMF, alongside a residual
component r(t). Therefore, a given input signal s(t) can
be decomposed as following
s(t) = c1..N (t) + r(t),

(5)

where N is the order of empirical mode decomposition
and the new notation ci..j (t) represents a simplified form
of the expression:
ci..j (t) =

j
X

ck (t)

(6)

k=i

Each IMF, ck (t), represents an oscillatory mode found
in the original signal, while r(t) accounts for a residual
trend not captured by the EMD. Following EMD, the
subsequent step is Hilbert spectral analysis, which employs the Hilbert transform to compute each IMF’s, or
any combination of IMF’s, instantaneous amplitude (IA)

5
and frequency (IF). This is usually achieved by computing the analytic signal c̃k (t) from the k-th IMF ck (t), as
following
c̃k (t) = ck (t) + iH[ck (t)],

The initial HHT uses a basic EMD as a decomposition
method but often encounters problems such as mode mixing and mode splitting [56]. These issues were addressed
in a series of empirical updates over the years aiming to
improve stability.
• Wu and Huang [56] proposed an extension of EMD
called Ensemble EMD (EEMD). EEMD works by
adding white Gaussian noise to the original signal and
performing EMD on multiple realizations of the noisy
signal. By averaging the IMFs obtained from different realizations, EEMD improves the accuracy of the
decomposition.
• Another extension called Complementary EEMD
(CEEMD) was proposed by Yeh et al. [57] to enhance
the decomposition further. In this method, white
Gaussian noise is added in pairs —both positive and
negative— to the original signal, producing two sets
of ensemble IMFs. The final IMFs are the ensemble
of both the IMFs with positive and negative noises.
The algorithmic steps of this technique are described
in Appendix A.
Extensive details on the computation of the HHT are
provided in Refs. [40, 41, 43].
Moreover, the detailed parametrization of the HHT
used in this analysis is listed in Table I and applies to
both the‘he3.5’ and ‘y20’ models.

Inference of the physical properties of PNSs involves
utilizing the g-mode universal relations [32, 33]:
f (t) = a + bx(t) + cx(t)2 + dx(t)3 ,

(10)

where f (t) is the frequency of the g-mode, and x(t) represents the PNS mass MPNS in solar masses divided by the
squared radius RPNS in kilometers. Using the computed
IFs and the parameters in Table II, we solve the cubic
equation Eq. (10) for each time to obtain the time evo2
. Solutions to the cubic equations
lution of MPNS /RPNS
are computed via the eigenvalues of the companion matrix [58]. Finally, we average the estimated values from
the three ET detectors.
Eventually, to compare method outcomes in the discussion section, we utilize the root mean squared error
(RMSE), defined by

where N is the total number of samples, yi represents the

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In this section, we first present our results for the pure
GW signals. Next, we will discuss the results for GW
signals injected into ET detector noise. For each detector and distance, we generated a hundred randomized
sequences of colored Gaussian noise. The distances considered for the GW signals range from 1 kpc to 29 kpc.

A.

Simple case: pure gravitational wave signals

In this first step, we apply our approach to the pure
GW signals, which were discussed in Sec. II A. In this
case, cWB reconstruction is not required.
Figure 6 shows the extracted IMFs of the ‘he3.5’ signal
using CEEMD with parameters listed in Table I. We then
apply the Hilbert spectral analysis to estimate the IAs
and IFs from the obtained IMFs. The resulting timefrequency map is shown in Fig. 7 (a). In this plot, the
frequencies of four IMFs are shown, with IMF1, IMF2,
IMF3, and IMF4 representing the highest to the lowest
frequencies. Figure 7 (b) shows the time-frequency map

tained from the numerical simulations and are used to
calculate the RMSEs. For the ‘he3.5’ model, although
the estimates from the STFT map exhibit some irregularities, they closely approximate the true values across
all time. In contrast, the estimates from the HHT are
smoother and align more closely with the true values.
The ratio of the RMSE for the HHT to that for STFT
is 0.66, indicating that the HHT provides approximately
33.9% lower error compared to STFT.
For the ‘y20’ model, the RMSE of the HHT is approximately 4.1% lower than that of STFT. Both methods
yield larger RMSE values compared to the ‘he3.5’ model,
as the estimates progressively deviate from the 2 g2 mode
after 0 s. Despite this, both methods provide similar estimates, indicating that both the HHT and STFT can
extract the frequencies of the 2 g2 mode with comparable
accuracy.

generated using STFT for comparison. Purple line in the
STFT time-frequency map corresponds to the frequency
with the maximum amplitude for each time bin. We
compare the IFs of the HHT map and the purple line of
STFT map to estimate the frequency of the g-mode.
Figure 8 shows the IFs and IAs of the HHT along with
the 2 g1 and 2 g2 modes associated with the ‘he3.5’ model.
The IF1 appears to estimate the intermediate frequency
between the 2 g1 and 2 g2 modes from −0.2 s to −0.1 s. In
general, the evolution of g-modes spans a wide frequency
range, from a low frequency of ∼ 200 Hz to several thousand Hz. This wide frequency range makes it challenging
to decompose the signal into a single IMF, potentially
leading to the mode splitting issue [56]. Our result also
indicates that this problem occurs, as the 2 g2 mode appears to be separated into several IFs, such as IF1 around
0 s, IF2 around −0.2 s, and IF3 around −0.3 s. In this
case, summing the IMFs before applying Hilbert spectral
analysis is one empirical method to mitigate the effect of
mode splitting. Figure 9 shows the sums of the three IFs
and three IAs, labeled as IF1..3 and IA1..3 , respectively.
Note that IMF4 is excluded from the summation due to
its relatively small IA and the estimated IF being below
200 Hz, which is outside the frequency range of the 2 g2
mode.
To estimate M/R2 , the extracted frequencies were averaged across the three ET detectors, and the universal
relation for the 2 g2 mode, as given in Eq. (10), was solved
at each time step. Figure 10 shows the calculated M/R2
for both the ‘he3.5’ and ‘y20’ models, using the extracted
frequencies from the STFT map (Fig. 7 (b)) and IF1..3 .
The green lines in Fig. 10 represent the true values ob-

Detector noise-added gravitational wave signal

The GW waveforms were injected in simulated 100 different detector noises and the injected waveforms in each
noise were reconstructed by cWB [16–18].
Figure 11 shows the distributions of the network match
defined in Eq. (2) as the function of each distance or network SNR in Eq. (4) for each signal model. The plot
exhibits the expected behavior; when the source distance
is small, the cWB can accurately reconstruct the waveform. As the distance increases, the network match decreases, and its variance increases. Similar results are observed for the ‘y20’ case, despite that the network match
is larger than the ‘he3.5’ case.
Estimation of M/R2 is conducted via three methods; (i) the method ‘STFT’ denotes the extraction
of frequencies from the original STFT map using the
frequencies with maximum amplitude for each time
bin, (ii) ‘cWB+STFT’ refers to the application of the
cWB waveform reconstruction and the extraction of frequencies from the reconstructed STFT map, and (iii)
‘cWB+HHT’ denotes the use of the cWB waveform reconstruction and the HHT.
The RMSE for each method is shown in Fig. 12 for
each signal model. In the ‘he3.5’ case, for signals with
distances less than 7 kpc, the three methods exhibit almost the same RMSE. However, as the source distance
increases, the STFT-based method experiences significantly increased RMSEs, due to the influence of noise
other than the 2 g2 mode signal. As the distance increases,
the two methods employing the cWB waveform reconstruction reduce the effect of noise through the extraction
of coherent 2 g2 mode signals across multiple detectors.
Regarding the ‘y20’ case, the RMSE of the STFT-based
method increases at the distances greater than 15 kpc,
while for the ‘he3.5’ case, the RMSE starts to increase at
9 kpc. As for the accuracy of signal reconstruction shown
in Fig. 11, the network match of the ‘y20’ signal at 15
kpc is equal to that of the ‘he3.5’ signal at 9 kpc. These

results imply that for signals with the same reconstruction accuracy, the estimation error of M/R2 is also similar. Furthermore, the two methods, ‘cWB+STFT’ and
‘cWB+HHT’, have equivalent RMSE values and the estimation. Based on these results, we conclude that both
the ‘cWB + STFT’ and ‘cWB + HHT’ methods provide
estimations of M/R2 with comparable accuracy.
In conclusion, our HHT approach showed similar results to the STFT-based one in terms of the RMSE, highlighting the potential of this approach as a complementary method to extract the physical properties of PNSs
from GW signals of CCSNe.

of our method to extract the g-mode frequencies. We
then tested our approach, the combination of the cWB
reconstruction and the HHT, for the signal injected into
the ET detector noise. Our new approach showed comparable results to the STFT-based one in terms of the
RMSE.
For the extraction of the 2 g2 mode using the HHT,
the multiple g-modes appear in the IMFs. In this study,
we utilize the combined IMFs to reduce the effect of
mode splitting. Further improved techniques for addressing mode mixing and splitting will enhance the performance of extraction. Furthermore, such techniques can
be applied not only to the extraction of multiple g-modes
but also to the extraction of other features such as the
SASI [59, 60]. Our new complementary approach shows
comparable results, and having two independent methods
that yield equivalent accuracy might be valuable in realworld applications where the actual value is unknown. To
validate the efficacy of our method further, testing with
additional simulation data is necessary. For waveform reconstruction, we utilized the cWB algorithm, which does

not assume a waveform model in advance. We will also
use another reconstruction method, BayesWave [61, 62],
and test the effectiveness of our method.

Appendix A: Complementary ensemble empirical
mode decomposition

We employ the complementary ensemble empirical
mode decomposition [57] to decompose signals into intrinsic mode functions. The decomposition process of a
signal s(t) is as follows:
1. Generate N time-series sequences {nk (t)} (k =
1, . . . , N ), where each sequence represents white
Gaussian noise with mean zero and standard deviation σ.
(+)

2. Construct noise-added signal sk (t) and noise(−)
subtracted signal sk (t) to the target signal s(t):
(±)

sk (t) = s(t) ± nk (t)

(A1)

for k = 1, . . . , N .
(±)

3. Employ EMD to each sk (t) with the stoppage
criterion based on a Cauchy convergence test
with a predetermined value ϵ [40] to obtain IMFs
(±)
(±)
{ci,k (t)}, alongside the residuals rk (t):
(±)

sk (t) =

X (±)
(±)
ci,k (t) + rk (t).
