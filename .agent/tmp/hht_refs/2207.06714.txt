ABSTRACT
We analyze the gravitational wave signals with a model-independent time-frequency analysis, which
is improved from the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) and optimized for characterizing the frequency
variability on the time-frequency map. Except for the regular HHT algorithm, i.e., obtaining intrinsic
mode functions with ensemble empirical mode decomposition and yielding the instantaneous frequencies, we propose an alternative algorithm that operates the ensemble mean on the time-frequency
map. We systematically analyze the known gravitational wave events of the compact binary coalescence observed in LIGO O1 and O2, and in the simulated gravitational wave signals from core-collapse
supernovae (CCSNe) with our method. The time-frequency maps of the binary black hole coalescence
cases show much better details compared to those wavelet spectra. Moreover, the oscillation in the
instantaneous frequency caused by mode-mixing could be reduced with our algorithm. For the CCSNe
data, the oscillation from the proto-neutron star and the radiation from the standing accretion shock
instability can be precisely determined with the HHT in great detail. More importantly, the initial
stage of different modes of oscillations can be clearly separated. These results provide new hints for
further establishment of the detecting algorithm, and new probes to investigate the underlying physical
mechanisms.

1. INTRODUCTION

The successful detection of the gravitational wave signal from the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave
Observatory (LIGO) opens a new window in both astronomy and physics (Abbott et al. 2016a). The advanced Virgo (aVirgo) interferometer also joined the engineer run with two aLIGO detectors since May of 2017.
At the end of 2018 for the first and second observation runs (O1 and O2), aLIGO and the aVirgo has conCorresponding author: C.-P. Hu

firmed 11 gravitational wave (GW) transients, including
10 merging events from two massive stellar-mass black
holes (BHs) and one from the coalescence of two neutron
stars (NSs) (Abbott et al. 2019). Until the end of 3rd observation run in March of 2020, the aVirgo and aLIGO
network have confirmed 90 GW events (The LIGO Scientific Collaboration et al. 2021), and 50 of which have
been reported during the first half of the third observing run (O3) (Abbott et al. 2021). These GW events
can be detected by multi-resolution techniques including wavelet Q-transform (Chatterji et al. 2004).
It has been suggested that the novel time-series analysis method, the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), could

Hu et al.

precisely describe the time-frequency properties of the
GW signal owing to the high resolution of the HHT
(Camp et al. 2007). The GW signal can be extracted
from the simulated data with a BH merging signal embedded in a noisy background (Stroeer et al. 2009).
Similar work has been extended to investigate the simulated GW signal from the coalescence of binary NSs
(Kaneyama et al. 2016).
The first and strongest event GW 150914 has been
analyzed with the HHT (Sakai et al. 2017). The signal
is not able to be decomposed into a single component
through empirical mode decomposition (EMD). The ensemble EMD (EEMD) has been proposed to overcome
the so-called ‘mode-mixing” or “mode-splitting” problem (Wu & Huang 2004; Wu & Huang 2009) but it is
only valid for a signal with moderate frequency variability because EEMD is equivalent to a dyadic filter. This
prevents getting a precise instantaneous frequency although the signal from different components with highest Hilbert amplitude could marginally connected with
each other. The entire time-frequency map could be
consistent with the theoretical prediction although some
frequency modulations can be clearly seen. A systematic investigation of known GW events using the HHT
is carried out by Akhshi et al. (2021). A physical time
delay could be derived from the reconstructed waveform.
In this paper, we comprehensively apply the Morlet
wavelet analysis and the HHT on the LIGO data of the
known GW events to test if the HHT is eligible to detect
the trigger. Moreover, we propose an alternative method
to obtain the Hilbert spectrum by stacking the timefrequency map instead of taking the ensemble mean of
components in the data sets with artificial noises. Besides the coalescence events in the LIGO data sets, we
also tested the algorithm on the simulated GW signal
from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). Section 2 describes the reduction and processing of the LIGO data,
and the mathematical algorithm used in this research.
We present the analysis result of two cases, GW 150914
and GW170817, in Section 3. The time-frequency maps
of other events are shown in Appendix A. We describe
the models and parameters used in generating the CCSN
signal, and show the corresponding analytical result of a
typical CCSN case in Section 4. Cases with other rotational parameters and viewing geometries are presented
in Appendix B.
2. DATA REDUCTION AND TIME-FREQUENCY

ANALYSIS ALGORITHM
2.1. LIGO Data Reduction
In order to examine the capability of our numerical
method, we check the performance of our algorithm on

the known GW events in GWTC-1 (A gravitationalwave transient catalog of compact binary mergers observed by LIGO and Virgo during the first and second observing runs) within 2015–2017. We use the 32 s
data of 4KHz released from the LIGO Open Science
Center1 (Vallisneri et al. 2015) obtained from Hanford
and Livingston sites to perform our analysis. We notice that a strong glitch and a GW candidate event
(i.e., GW 170817) occurred almost simultaneously at
the Livingston site, and therefore we downloaded the
‘clean’ data after the noise subtracting following the
glitch model described in Abbott et al. (2017a).
Table 1 lists data sets of known GW events considered in this article, and all the signal processing was
proceeded with the python based GW analysis library
named as GWPY v2.1.02 (Macleod et al. 2020). To deal
with the GW data, we followed the standard whitening
process to suppress the extra colored noise at low frequencies and spectral lines led by instrumental or background effects (see, e.g., Usman et al. 2016; Abbott et al.
2019). This operation might affect the nonlinearily of
the GW signal. We note that whitening process is parameter dependent and the method is not unique (see,
e.g., Tsukada et al. 2018; Huang et al. 2021). Further
developments of the de-noising techniques would be important though this is beyond the scope of this research.
We therefore whitened the time series to enhance the
higher-frequency content with a FFT integration length
of 4 s and 2 s-overlap between FFTs for the given window of Hann smoothing. We also apply a bandpass filter
to reserve the data within 30–450 Hz and then use notch
filters to attenuate line noises because we want to suppress the effect from thermal noises of mirrors, quantum
noise of laser or any line noise arisen from detector resonances to dominate the spectral behavior.
To confirm the practicability of our methods, we also
check the instantaneous frequency obtained from the
simulated gravitational waveform. We generate the
waveform using the effective-one-body (EOB; Taracchini
et al. 2014; Pürrer 2016; Bohé et al. 2017) numericalrelativity (NR) model. The simulated GW time series
can be obtained by employing apps (LAL 6.19.1; LIGO
Scientific Collaboration 2018) provided by the LIGO
Algorithm Library3 . The basic physical parameters of
GW150914 applied in the simulated waveform refer to
those determined in GWTC-1 (Abbott et al. 2019).

2.2. Hilbert-Huang Transform
The Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) is a novel timefrequency analysis algorithm that can trace frequency
variability in a great detail (Huang et al. 1998). This
adaptive method needs no priori basis, and has been
widely used in many fields of science and engineering
(see, e.g., Huang et al. 1999; Huang & Attoh-Okine 2005;
Huang & Shen 2014). The core idea of the HHT is the
Hilbert transform of a time series x(t):
Z ∞
1
x(t0 ) 0
y(t) = P
dt ,
(1)
0
π
−∞ t − t
where P indicates the Cauchy principal value and y(t)
is the Hilbert transform of x(t). With this definition, we
can have an analytical signal
z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) = a(t)eiθ(t)
(2)
p
where a(t) = x2 (t) + y 2 (t) is the Hilbert amplitude
and θ(t) = tan−1 [y(t)/x(t)] is the instantaneous phase
function. The time derivative of θ(t)
ω(t) =

dθ(t)
dt

(3)

can be defined as the instantaneous frequency. As the
development of the HHT, a few more methods were
also proposed to obtain the frequency, such as generalized zero-crossing, and direct quadrature (Huang et al.

2009). In our study, we mainly utilize the normalized
Hilbert transform, which applying the Hilbert transform
after normalizing the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs)
to the range between −1 and 1. This is designed to
overcome the limitation imposed by the Bedrosian theorem (Bedrosian 1962; Xu & Yan 2006). In some cases
the intra-wave modulation, i.e., frequency modulation
within one cycle that caused by possible non-linear effect of an oscillation system, is not physically important,
we use the generalized zero-crossing, which is a robust
method to calculate the inter-wave modulation (i.e., the
variation of a cycle length) frequency (Sekhar & Sreenivas 2004). Both methods yield a fully consistent result.
However, the instantaneous frequency is meaningful
only if the input time series is an IMF, which must be
symmetry with respect to zero, and the number of extrema and zero-crossing must be the same or at least
differs by one. This criterion is difficult to be achieved
in real data. A pre-processing is needed. Therefore, the
HHT consists of two steps: (1) decompose the time series data into finite IMFs and (2) obtain instantaneous
frequencies for each IMFs (Wu & Huang 2009).
The first method proposed for the decomposition is
the empirical mode decomposition (EMD). EMD is an
iterative process called “sifting” that extracts IMFs by
removing the local mean values obtained from taking the
average of the upper and lower envelope of a time series

(Huang et al. 1998). It can separate time series into
IMFs of different time scales, and make IMFs symmetric
with respect to zero.
In principle, there are infinite way to decompose the
signal. For example, different sifting parameters, e.g.,
stoppage criteria, spline method, etc. A confidence limit
for Hilbert spectrum can be obtained from an ensemble
of valid IMFs resulting from different sifting parameters.
The ideal case is that the raw time series x(t) can be
decomposed as
x(t) =

n
X
j=1

cj (t) + r(t) =

n
X

aj (t)ei

R

ωj (t)dt

+ r(t) (4)

j=1

where cj (t) is the j-th IMF, and r(t) is the nonoscillating residual.
A signal with a narrow modulation timescale is expected to be decomposed in a single IMF. However, it
could be decomposed into different IMFs using EMD if
there are noises or intermittent signals. This “modemixing” problem can be solved by introducing white
noise with finite amplitude into the data and taking the
ensemble mean of corresponding obtained from all the
simulated sets. This is the Ensemble EMD (EEMD)
(Wu & Huang 2009). Based on the study of white noise,
the EEMD is a dyadic filter that collates signals of sim-

ilar scales together. The remaining problem is that the
summation of IMFs is no longer an IMF. Therefore, a
post-processing EMD is needed (Wu & Huang 2009).
One can apply the post-processing EMD from arbitrary
components of interest. Here we use it since the first
IMF, the highest frequency mode of the signal. The
entire procedure is shown as Figure 1(a).
When applying EEMD, two more parameters are
needed to be considered: the amplitude of the input
noise σn and the number of ensemble trials N . Unlike
EMD, the completeness of the signal is not guaranteed
in EEMD due to the input noise. Therefore, a large N
is needed to minimize the incompleteness of the output
signal, which costs high computing resources. To reduce
the computing time, the EEMD has been improved by
adding a pair of positive and negative noises. This operation is also named as complementary EEMD (CEEMD
Yeh et al. 2010). With this operation, a good completeness can be achieved compared to the original version of
EEMD (see, e.g., Figure 6 in Yeh et al. 2010). With our
parameter setting, the deviation between the summation
of IMFs and the original time series is ∼ 10−15 times of
the deviation of the original time series. This algorithm
has been included in the Matlab fast EEMD package
as the default EEMD algorithm, which is developed by

5

The OI can be defined specifically for any IMF of interest or between all IMFs. Because the GW signal usually
spread in a wide frequency range, we minimize the overall OI presented in equation 5.
However, the GW signal of the coalescence of two compact objects usually spans a wide frequency range, which
is difficult to be decomposed into a single IMF with
EEMD. This makes it difficult to trace the evolution of
the signal in detail, especially near the boundary when
the signal migrates from one IMF to another. For visualization purpose, we establish a stacked Hilbert spectrum
algorithm to trace the time-frequency property of GW
signals.
The idea of our algorithm is demonstrated in Figure
1(b). Similar to EEMD, we first add finite noises into
the signal and create N simulated time series. Then, we
apply EMD or EEMD on the noise-inserted time series
to obtain IMFs. After this, we did not take the ensemble
mean of IMFs. Instead, we calculate the instantaneous
frequency and amplitudes of individual IMFs in each
simulated data set. Finally, we stack all the Hilbert
spectra on the time-frequency map. The basic idea is
that the variability of the instantaneous frequency introduced by the mode-splitting effect would be different
in each set of added white noise. As a result, the true
frequency evolution would be enhanced on the stacked
map, and the spurious variability would be smeared out.
The detailed mathematical proof and statistical study of
this method will be presented in another paper (Yen et
al. in prep).

A pywrapper of this package4 is also available (Su 2017).
We also tried to perform the following analysis using the
complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with

denotes the 1-sigma interval obtained from the simulated
data sets.

3.1. GW150914
We obtain the LIGO data and whiten them using the
data reduction pipeline described in Section 2.1. We
first input white noises with σ = 1.0 times the deviation
of the data and perform 104 times of such simulations
(step 1 in Figure 1). This is helpful to obtain confidence
intervals because the whitened data can be treated as
the Gaussian white noise except for a short time interval that contains GW signal. Then, we try both EMD
and EEMD on the simulated time series (step 2 in Figure 1). Further input of noise in EEMD is needed, and
we observe the variability of the OI with different noise
levels between 0 and 5 times the deviation of the data
(see Figure 2). We found that the OI could be minimized with σ ≈ 0.3, and therefore we use it for the
following analysis. We then stack the Hilbert spectra
on the 2-dimensional map to smear the boundary effect
when the GW signal was split into two nearby IMFs.
Figure 3 shows the decomposition result and the
Hilbert spectra of GW 150914 observed with LIGO Hanford (left) and Livingstone (right). Panel (a) shows
the whitened data and the summation of IMF3–5. Because the GW signal spans from ∼ 50 Hz to ∼ 300 Hz,
it matches the characteristic time scales of IMFs 3
(∼ 340 Hz)–IMF 5 (∼ 80 Hz) based on the fact that the
EEMD is a dyadic filter and the sampling rate is 4096
Hz. In this case, the summation of IMFs 3–5 can greatly
reproduce the waveform. This operation is equivalent to
applying EEMD band-pass filter to the data. We plotted
the decomposed IMFs 3–5 in Figure 3 b–d, respectively.
It clearly shows that the GW signal firstly appears in
IMF5, then migrates toward the high-frequency components, IMF4 and IMF3.

We performed the normalized Hilbert transform to
calculate the Hilbert energy, which is defined as the
square of the amplitude, and instantaneous frequency of
each IMFs, and stacked those obtained from IMFs 3–5 to
minimize the contribution from other frequency ranges.
This operation is done for all 104 simulated data sets (see
Figure 1) and thus we obtained the mean value and deviation of the band-pass filtered Hilbert energy (Figure
3e). This instantaneous Hilbert energy can be used to
detect the GW signal. We use the Bayesian block technique to detect occurrence times of significant change in
the Hilbert energy (Scargle et al. 2013). GW150914 is
the strongest event in the LIGO O1/O2 catalog where

the boundaries can be easily detected if we set the null
hypothesis probability p0 to be 10−80 .

algorithms with 104 times of simulation are presented

Figure 4. Comparison between the stacked HHT spectrum
(color map), WWZ spectrum (contour) and the instantaneous frequency of the template (blue line) of GW 150914
observed with LIGO Hanford detector. Three slices are labeled by the dashed line for low-frequency (a), intermediate
frequency (b), and high-frequency (c) regimes. The amplitude versus frequency plot (or spectral density) are plotted
in the lower panels. Density maps of the instantaneous amplitude and frequency of the specific time of all simulation
are shown as black dots, where the red profile is the averaged profile for the instantaneous frequency. The green curve
denotes the result from the WWZ, where the blue dashed
line indicates the instantaneous frequency obtained from the

velope. We set it as c = 0.0125 (Foster 1996). These four
algorithms yielded consistent results in the frequency
evolution. However, the wavelet analysis has a trade-off
between the frequency and the temporal resolutions by
setting the width of the Gaussian window. The timefrequency property would be smeared out. In comparison, the Hilbert spectrum shows a strikingly good resolution on the time-frequency map and indicates the precise time of the incoming GW signal. The mode-mixing
may introduce a few nonphysical modulations when the
signal crosses two IMFs. Except for this, HHT would be
an ideal tool to study the detailed time-frequency structure of the GW signals induced by two BHs coalescence.
To compare the analysis result between different algorithms and the model template, we simulated the
GW waveform using the python-based open software

to explore astrophysical sources of GWs, PyCBCv2.0.16
(Usman et al. 2016), with the approximant given by
the effective-one-body (EOB; Taracchini et al. 2014;
Pürrer 2016; Bohé et al. 2017) NR model. The instantaneous frequency of the template can be directly
calculated via Hilbert transform without decomposing
it into IMFs because the template fits the IMF criterion during the merging phase. The resulting instantaneous frequency of the template, the WWZ spectrum,
and the stacked Hilbert spectrum are plotted in Figure
4. The time-frequency map of the HHT can clearly describe the instantaneous frequency in better detail compared to that of the wavelet spectrum. To demonstrate
this, we choose three slices in (a) low-frequency, (b)
intermediate-frequency, and (c) high-frequency regimes.
The slices of the HHT and WWZ spectra, as well as the
instantaneous frequency obtained from the template, are
shown in panel (a)–(c) of Figure 4. The gray color map
denotes the density of the Hilbert energy-frequency pairs
of each trial. The HHT result at epoch (b) is most ambiguous because the GW signal switches from one IMF
to another at this time. However, the performance of
the HHT remains comparable to that of the WWZ.
GW150914 is one of the strongest signals recorded
in GWTC-1. We analyzed all the BH-BH coalescence
events in GWTC-1 and present the results in the appendix (See Figure A1 – A9). These signals have been
analyzed in a combination with the HHT and de-noise
algorithm using a network array (Akhshi et al. 2021).
The instantaneous frequency can be detected but large
variability in the instantaneous frequency is occasionally
seen (see, e.g., Figure 4 in Akhshi et al. 2021). These
signals could be minimized by our stacking method.
3.2. GW170817
GW170817 is the first confirmed NS-NS coalescence
event (Abbott et al. 2017a). A γ-ray burst and multiwavelength afterglows is a benchmark of the multimessenger astronomy era (Abbott et al. 2017b). Compared to other BH-BH coalescence obtained in GWTC1 (Abbott et al. 2019), the signal of GW170817 has a
much longer coherence time but the amplitude is much
weaker. We tested both the WWZ and the HHT algorithms on this event. The signal can be seen on the
wavelet map with c = 0.00125, ten times smaller than
the c value for BH-BH coalescence events. Compared to
the signals of BH-BH events, the amplitude of the NSNS signal is much lower, and the signal keeps its coherence for a long while. The nearly coherent signal before

the merging makes it possible to be detected with this
setting, but the time-frequency property near the merging phase is smeared in time due to the large Gaussian
window. In contrast, the signal is difficult to be resolved in the HHT time-frequency map. Because the
HHT is sensitive to both the instantaneous variability
of the frequency and the noise, the signal-to-noise ratio
of this event is insufficient for the HHT to identify its
intrinsic time-frequency property. Therefore, the HHT
could be powerful for future NS-NS coalescence events
with improved GW observatories in the next generation
that could have a high signal-to-noise ratio.
4. CORE-COLLAPSE SUPERNOVAE

Detection of GW signals from a nearby CCSN will
be the next milestone of gravitational wave astrophysics
(Abbott et al. 2016b, 2020). It would be crucial for
multi-messenger astronomy because the possible co-

detection of gravitational waves and neutrinos would allow astronomers to probe the activity of the center of a
massive star during the final evolutionary stage. Thanks
to the growth of computing power, our knowledge of the
explosion engine of a CCSN improved dramatically. Owing to the asymmetric and complex fluid motion and the
oscillation/evolution of the proto-neutron star (PNS),
complex gravitational signals with multiple components
are expected to be investigated from three-dimensional
high-fidelity self-consistent CCSN simulations (Janka
et al. 2016; Burrows & Vartanyan 2021). CCSN waveforms depend on several physical quantities, such as the
core angular momentum and the composition of the collapsar, the nuclear equation of state, and the dynamics
of fluid instabilities. The future multi-messenger observations will place meaningful constraints on the supernova engines and the microphysics.

The gravitational waveforms of CCSNe simulations
used in this project are adopted from the threedimensional self-consistent CCSN simulations with the
Isotropic Diffusion Source Approximation (Liebendörfer
et al. 2009) for the neutrino transport, using the FLASH
code (Fryxell et al. 2000) and are presented in Pan et al.
(2021). The data are derived from a 40M progenitor
at zero-age main sequence with solar metallicity from
Woosley & Heger (2007) with three different initial rotational speeds (Ω0 = 0, 0.5 and 1 rad s−1 ) at the onset
of core-collapse. A post-Newtonian treatment with the
effective general relativity potential (Marek et al. 2006)
and the Lattimer−Swesty (LS220) equation of state are
considered (Lattimer & Swesty 1991).
The GW strains are evaluated by the first time derivative of the mass quadrupole moment with an assumption of a fixed distance d = 10 kpc to an observer. The
second time derivative of the mass quadrupole moment
is calculated by the finite difference in post-processing,
using the formula described in Scheidegger et al. (2008)
and Murphy et al. (2009). We simulated two viewing
angles, where the observers are in the infinity in the direction of the equatorial plane or the rotational axis.
4.2. Analysis of Simulated CCSNe Waveforms
Here we take the gravitational waveform of the nonrotating model with an observer viewed from the equatorial direction as an example for our HHT analysis. The
gravitational waveforms of other models with different
parameters are shown in the appendix (Figure A10 –
A20). Figure 6 (a) shows the simulated strains, which
followed by the wavelet spectra (b) – (c) and the stacked
HHT spectra (d) – (e). The waveform starts from the
core collapse and reaches the core bounce at t = 0 s.
Since this model is non-rotating and the proto-neutron
star convection happens after the core bounce, the gravitational strain shows a loud bounce signal at time zero,
and then it is followed by a low-frequency peak PNS
oscillation, which could be caused by the g-mode oscillation although the nature remains controversial (Müller
et al. 2013; Pan et al. 2021). Multiple low-frequency oscillation signals dominate the first ∼ 0.15 s and they

Nevertheless, recent theoretical works have reached
consensuses on a few main structures of the GW signal
on the time-frequency domain. These provide a strong
basis to improve searching algorithms. On the other
hand, the HHT is likely the most precise tool to investigate the detailed time-frequency properties of the CCSNe. Here we adopted the gravitational waveforms from
the self-consistent three-dimensional CCSN simulations
with neutrino transport in Pan et al. (2021).

can be well resolved with the HHT. In comparison, the
limitation of the wavelet spectrum prevents us to identify them. As the frequency of the oscillation increases
with time, another high-frequency mode oscillation signal appears with similar strength as the peak PNS mode.
The low-frequency PNS oscillation vanishes at t ∼ 0.5 s.
Then, interestingly, it followed by the quadruple radiation of the standing accretion shock instability (SASI
Blondin et al. 2003) signal, which was suggested to be
seen in the GW data Kuroda et al. (2016); Pan et al.
(2021). The detailed waveform of the SASI signal is
model dependent, but its time-frequency property has
been shown in a few analysis either with the spectrogram or the HHT (see, e.g., Andresen et al. 2017; Mezzacappa et al. 2020; Takeda et al. 2021). In our analysis,
the SASI signal can be seen on both the wavelet and
the HHT spectra. The wavelet and the HHT results for
other simulated CCSN events are shown in the appendix
B. The Hilbert spectra of all the data sets show much
better resolution than the wavelet spectra.
5. DISCUSSION

A Morlet wavelet consists of a complex exponential
carrier multiplied by a Gaussian window. It provides a
window size for both the low- and high-frequency regime

10

Hu et al.

that contains the same number of waves. The timefrequency map is distorted, and the signal is smeared
if the frequency of a signal changes drastically within a
few cycles (see. e.g., Figure 3 (f) – (g) and Figure 6 (b)
– (c)). A narrower width of the Gaussian envelope can
result in a better time resolution, although the frequency
resolution would be sacrificed.
On the other hand, the Hilbert analysis calculates the
instantaneous frequency of a signal. This helps trace the
signal’s detailed evolution of the time-frequency property. Moreover, the complex multi-component, lowfrequency signals of CCSNe can be well resolved with
the HHT. For example, the SASI signal in Figure 6 and
a few multiple low-frequency signals in Figures A12 –
A20 can only be clearly resolved in the Hilbert spectra.
Nevertheless, the HHT can decompose a fast-changing
signal into different IMFs. Fake frequency modulation
in the instantaneous frequency is seen when the signal crosses two components. This can be reduced with
the stacking algorithm suggested in this study, although
they cannot be entirely removed. Moreover, the signal
cannot be seen for low signal-to-noise ratio events. For
example, the NS-NS coalescence event GW 170817 can
be clearly detected with the wavelet analysis with a large
Gaussian width. This is because the signal keeps its coherence for a few more cycles compared to the BH-BH
coalescence events, but the signal-to-noise ratio within
a cycle is much lower.
Before stacking the time-frequency map, the evolution of Hilbert energy has gave hints of the GW signal.
A detailed time delay among instruments can be further characterized by cross-correlating the EMD filtered
profiles (Akhshi et al. 2021). In addition, the special
pattern of the GW signal across IMFs (see, e.g., Figure
3b – d) would form a remarkable feature in the twodimensional series where one dimension is time and another is IMF index. This would be helpful for detecting
the GW signal using convolution neural network.
The GW signal from a CCSN is believed to contain
multiple components, where they could across a large
range in the both the frequency and the energy. The
high resolutions of the HHT in both the time and frequency domains are helpful in distinguishing them from
each other, especially the low-frequency transient signals
within ∼ 0.4 s after the core bounce.

frequency map instead of taking the ensemble mean of
the IMFs. This helps visualize the evolution of the instantaneous frequency. We carried out an analysis for
LIGO O1 and O2 events and found that most of their
frequency evolution can be well tracked with our algorithm. Furthermore, the EEMD filtered data is used to
determine the time delay between Livingstone and Hanford sites. Except for the known GW sources, we also
tested our algorithm on the simulated CCSN events.
We found that multiple GW components can be obtained with the HHT. Compared to the wavelet analysis,
the unprecedented resolutions in both the time and frequency domains of the HHT are an ideal tool for further
investigating the time-frequency properties of a signal.
This provides evidence that the HHT can be a powerful tool in detecting CCSNe events for future multimessenger campaigns.

The HHT is a novel technique for time-frequency analysis although the mode-splitting problem is severe when
working with signals with huge frequency variability like
