    "# Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) Analysis Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial explains the procedure for **Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT)** analysis using **gwexpy**.\n",
    "HHT is well-suited for analyzing nonlinear and non-stationary signals, and is a powerful method for extracting local frequency variations (instantaneous frequency) that cannot be captured by conventional Fourier transform or wavelet transform.\n",
    "\n",
    "HHT consists of two main steps:\n",
    "1.  **Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD)**: Decomposes the signal into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs).\n",
    "2.  **Hilbert Spectral Analysis**: Performs Hilbert transform on each IMF to calculate instantaneous amplitude and instantaneous frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: To use this feature, the `PyEMD` (EMD-signal) package must be installed.\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install EMD-signal\n",
