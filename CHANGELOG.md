# Changelog

## [0.1.0b1] - TBD

### Initial Public Release

- This is the first public beta release of `gwexpy`. All previous development history (up to internal version 0.4.0) is consolidated here.

### Refactored

- **Exception Handling**: Eliminated broad `except Exception` patterns in NDS, GUI, and IO modules. Replaced with specific exception types (`OSError`, `ValueError`, `KeyError`, etc.) for more predictable error handling and better debugging.
- **GUI Architecture**: Improved separation of concerns between UI and core logic layers in GUI components.

### Added

- **Core Data Structures**:
  - `TimeSeries`, `FrequencySeries`, `Spectrogram` classes with metadata management.
  - `TimeSeriesMatrix`, `FrequencySeriesMatrix`, `SpectrogramMatrix` for multi-channel data handling.
  - `ScalarField`, `VectorField`, `TensorField` for 4D experimental domain semantics.
- **Numerical Semantics**:
  - Strict unit propagation for calculus methods.
  - Fixed DC component handling in integration to prevent singularities.
- **Advanced Signal Processing**:
  - functional Short-Time Laplace Transform (`stlt`).
  - High-performance resampling with various aggregation methods.
  - Whitening and standardization models.
- **Interoperability**:
  - Support for various file formats: TDMS, GBD, WIN, ATS, SDB/SQLite, WAV.
  - Integration with ML frameworks (Torch/TensorFlow) and ROOT (CERN).
  - MTH5 support for magnetotelluric data.
- **Fitting & Statistics**:
  - Comprehensive `fitting` module with `iminuit` and `emcee` (MCMC) support.
  - Statistical aggregation and interpolation for matrix structures.
- **GUI**:
  - Interactive GUI for real-time streaming data visualization and analysis.

### Improved

- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive type annotation expansion across the codebase:
  - Added strict type hints to GUI (UI layer, NDS modules, streaming, engine).
  - Enhanced `TimeSeriesMatrix` mixin with Protocol-based type-safe `super()` calls.
  - Introduced `TypedDict` definitions for structured data in IO and GUI modules.
  - Expanded MyPy coverage to include `gui/nds/` and `gui/ui/` directories.
- **CI Stability**:
  - Replaced deprecated `qtbot.waitForWindowShown()` with `qtbot.waitExposed()` in GUI tests.
  - Added warning filters to suppress third-party deprecation warnings (NumPy, pandas) in test configuration.
  - Refined MyPy exclude patterns for better coverage-exclusion balance.
- Optimized ROOT/NumPy vectorization.
- Refactored `noise` module for better maintenance.

### Fixed

- **GUI Tests**: Resolved flaky test issues related to window visibility timing.
- **Type Errors**: Fixed various MyPy errors including uninitialized attributes and missing return type annotations.
- Fixed unit propagation in complex matrix operations.
- Corrected IFFT amplitude scaling for one-sided spectra.
